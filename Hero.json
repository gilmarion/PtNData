    "1": "The price has been paid. This is the power I deserve.",
    "2": "It\\'s time. I must fulfill my promise.",
    "3": "Operation ON. Everybody stay alert.",
    "4": "Enemy targets cleared. Operation still on. Stay on your guard.",
    "5": "Haha... In the end, I\\'ve been able to protect nothing and no one...",
    "6": "Don\\'t dream of getting past me!",
    "7": "I\\'ve... let you down...",
    "8": "Corruptors, thugs and conspirators are still rampaging through the city... You should act now.",
    "9": "Maggots have infested this city, pulling strings to manipulate everyone. I want them dead.",
    "10": "Never underestimate the darkness lurking beneath this city. That\\'s a lesson that\\'s cost me everything.",

    "12": "It\\'s been eight years, and nothing has changed in the DisCity. Abel, together with his dream, has completely disappeared from people\\'s memories. Sometimes I wonder, what do they actually remember?",
    "13": "Murdering your own... father, your long-time subordinates, burying everything you cherish... You want to know what that feels like? Haha, you won\\'t like it.",

    "52": "Your skeletal frame is quite unique. Want to become the eighteenth-generation heir to lion dancing? ...Wait, is it eighteenth or nineteenth... What generation am I again? ...One, two, three...",
    "53": "There\\'s a saying where I come from: \\\\\"The awakened lion rousts, and brings in the God of Wealth!\\\\\" I\\'ll make sure to put on a rowdy show for you!",
    "54": "Lion dancing is hard work! It takes years to hone, and injuries are common! You really want to learn? Seriously? No takebacks? ...OwO has an apprentice! OwO has an apprentice! OwO has an apprentice!!!",
    "55": "Time to get up!!! <i>No way!<\/i> You really got scared? Hahahaha! People from DisCity are so funny!",
    "56": "I-I-I\\'m warning you! Those who disrespect lions won\\'t be protected! I won\\'t lift a finger when the monster comes to e-e-eat you! D-don\\'t come over here!",
    "57": "Feast your eyes upon the performance of the world\\'s most amazing, majestic, and invincible little genius OwO! Don\\'t blink!",
    "58": "When it comes to fun, how can DisCity compare to my hometown? If you weren\\'t so understaffed, I wouldn\\'t go out at all!",

    "72": "Deesman, hurry up and help Ouch move this store back to the MBCC cafeteria! The fries here are so good, I have to eat them every day!",
    "73": "I\\'m the Forbidden Owl, I\\'ve been affected by the Black Circle Rift and am now homeless, in order to eradicate the Black Circle and maintain peace in the world, please v me 50 to eat a big meal or else I won\\'t be able to fight the death service!",
    "74": "Camera! Must have been used to film me! Hmph, I didn\\'t realize that my reputation as the world\\'s number one invincible breakdancing lion cub genius had actually spread here! You guys wait, I\\'ll come to the show after I finish gnawing on this chicken leg!",

    "76": "No can do! It\\'s Owl\\'s burger! Eat your own! You\\'re too old to be taking food from people. Shame on you! Hmph! If I get mad, I\\'ll bite you like a big burger!",
    "77": "Burger, fries, chicken wings, egg tart, all of them again! ...... Why are you looking at me like that? I can eat a lot more! Don\\'t underestimate me!",
    "78": "Hmph. As an anti-Mania combatant, I will regard this series of actions targeting me as a simple \\\\\"work transfer.\\\\\" I will follow your arrangements. But if your orders conflicts with the will of that person, please forgive me in advance, Chief.",

    "101": "...Don\\'t mind me... It\\'ll all be over soon...",

    "122": "Arrived at the standby location, awaiting further instructions. Yes, the sun is dazzling and the temperature has risen, which favors the target to change clothes and evade search. We must pay more attention.",
    "123": "These steps are nothing. Keep going up.",
    "124": "In order to look more natural and blend into the environment well, we really should engage in some small talk now. In reference to the two office ladies over there, we might talk about our intolerant superiors.",
    "125": "For me, duties don\\'t change based on dress or role. Regardless of what I wear, I am your escort and will remove all obstacles for your safety. There\\'s nothing uncomfortable about that.",
    "126": "I\\'ve spotted several suspicious figures gathering in the distance, and they seem to be keeping a close eye on our movements... It is difficult to tell if they are armed at this distance. For your safety, we should relocate. Hmm? Just want my contact info? If you run into trouble, it\\'s better to call the sheriff, not me.",

    "128": "Touching in this manner is likely to be judged as aggressive behavior by a trained canine. I do not recommend that you continue.",

    "138": "You seem a bit different... Discrepancies arise over time. How long has it been... since we last met?",
    "139": "Behavior... must be guided by rules... A broken machine... will only lead one into eternal deviation... I\\'ll fix it for you...",
    "140": "Don\\'t change... Don\\'t deny it... Stay accurate... Stay... stable... I won\\'t break... My existence will reach the final border...",
    "141": "From springs and cogs... to bearings and internal combustion engines... to circuits and semiconductors... Humans today, technology a century later from my time... What will it look like...",
    "142": "In DisSea, all laws are distorted... Time, space, and even memory... are no longer trustworthy... Perhaps what I\\'m obsessed with is something that can be relied upon in this torrent.",
    "143": "Time won\\'t twist a person\\'s mind... Despair will... Remember your purpose. Remember the earliest promise. This way... even if you\\'re caught up by despair... it can\\'t devour you...",
    "144": "So this is what the world outside DisSea looks like now... I thought... the scenery there, the never-ending disaster, and my watchtower... would never change... until eternity...",
    "145": "I didn\\'t understand the meaning of our encounter before... But now, I do... It\\'s like eternal gears being worn down, errant currents returning to their source... Your arrival signaled... the everlasting first second has passed.",
    "146": "Time\\'s passing... at the normal rate... I\\'m not used to it yet...",
    "147": "Why repeat such movements? Your limbs are probably malfunctioning... Let me inspect and repair them for you now...",
    "148": "When my companions feel lost, they often come to me... I guess people are always seeking unchanging things as anchors in turmoil... Are you the same? Are you... feeling uneasy?",
    "149": "This is my direction...",
    "150": "No deviation in the return path... I\\'m home.",
    "151": "It\\'s more stable now...",

    "158": "Unknown threat.",
    "159": "Warn",
    "160": "Debugging completed... I can go even further now...",
    "161": "Sending out so many cops just to catch a Syndican gangster. Your subordinates are honestly... beyond useless.",
    "162": "It\\'s not enough to simply possess power. You must also put it to good use.",
    "163": "What do they say, that these are humanity\\'s limits? What a joke. Humans will never stop pushing beyond their limits.",
    "164": "I\\'ve been waiting for so long.",

    "169": "Hey, looks like you\\'re free. How about taking a trip to the Syndicate with me? Quite a few people are eager to meet you.",
    "170": "Your boss keeps switching my guards. Are they really so scared? Scared of an imprisoned Sinner, or a mediocre Syndican gangster?",
    "171": "My subordinates are not just obsessed with muscles, they adore the brainy type too. Hmm... You seem qualified. Quit working for the government and join the Legion!",
    "172": "Guns? We don\\'t rely on them in fights. A warrior trusts only their fists and their will. What\\'s more, Syndicate\\'s <i>guns<\/i> have long been tainted.",
    "173": "Only violence can end violence. That\\'s the only answer Syndicate has given us. Those who once had dreams have all died for nothing.",
    "174": "Those abandoned factories are remnants of the city\\'s golden era. That\\'s the glory Syndicans must reclaim.",
    "175": "\\\\\"No matter who they\\'ve lost, the Legion\\'s commander must remain calm.\\\\\" But if something happened to you, I can\\'t imagine what I would do...",
    "176": "When we first met, you were just a rookie I could easily lift with a single arm. It surprises me... how you haven\\'t changed a bit. But you\\'re also the strongest person I\\'ve ever met. I\\'ll keep counting on you in the future, Chief.",
    "177": "It does look like there are a few people here... I can have a bout with.",
    "178": "Are you... provoking me?",
    "179": "Are you going to just watch? Why don\\'t we have a bout instead? I\\'ll stand there without moving, and I won\\'t even use my hands.",
    "180": "A piece of cake. My guys in the Legion will get it done in no time.",
    "181": "See? Told you it was easy.",
    "182": "Hmm... That\\'s not enough.",
    "183": "Wow, you\\'re pretty brave...",
    "184": "Time for a little exercise.",
    "185": "Danger!",
    "186": "Mmm.",

    "188": "(Bellows)",
    "189": "Yes?",
    "190": "Huh?!",
    "191": "It\\'s not enough to simply possess power. You must also put it to good use.",
    "192": "Tell those gangs that the Legion is here—to declare war on all of you!",
    "193": "Humph. I look forward to the battle.",
    "194": "Ha, you\\'re late. Keep up. Didn\\'t you say you want to witness the reformation of Syndicate? Stay with me at all times then.",
    "195": "I feel like you\\'ve... got a lot more guts lately.",
    "196": "Who will be our first opponent? Ted? Yagyu? Why don\\'t they all come at once? It will be the same.",
    "197": "I\\'ll leave the planning to Earl. I just need to open the way ahead—which is what he needs most.",
    "198": "Rust, smoke, and endless violence. Syndicate never changes. I\\'m sick of it... Go. Destroy everything. It\\'s time for a change.",
    "199": "The Legion doesn\\'t need a stronghold. The whole of Syndicate is the territory of the wolves.",
    "200": "We have more enemies than this, but as long as those guys in the gutter dare to show up...",
    "201": "Oh? Have you finally decided to join the Legion?",
    "202": "As you can see, the negotiation was a huge success.",
    "203": "Your words carry weight only when you have the power.",
    "204": "You came. Unfortunately, the negotiation has ended prematurely. This place looks quite impressive, doesn\\'t it? As good a place for conversation as any.",
    "205": "Your bravery never ceases to amaze.",
    "206": "Hehe, to tame a beast, you must become more ferocious and savage than them.",
    "207": "The future of Syndicate? Sigh, I don\\'t have the answer to that yet, but I will find it, in my own way.",
    "208": "Do you envy them? I can tell that you do by the look in your eyes.",
    "209": "The fire of violence has died, but the embers remain in our heart, smoldering in every dark corner and waiting to be reignited.",
    "210": "You did a great job guarding this place. Good doggy.",
    "211": "This outfit is not bad for a negotiation meeting, but I\\'m not going to move as freely in this if things get physical... Sigh...Well, it\\'s a nice gift from you guys, after all.",
    "212": "I can see... the pain and madness consuming you...",
    "213": "The stronger a Sinner... the closer they are to destruction...",
    "214": "The abyss is no longer my prison.",
    "215": "I hear the call of the abyss...",
    "216": "They will suffer no longer... That is good.",
    "217": "No, they\\'re not yet at peace...",
    "218": "Death is your only destination!",
    "219": "I... don\\'t want to... die...",
    "220": "That was close. I was almost devoured by those voices again. Luckily... you came.",
    "221": "The blood that stained this sword... I will never forget it.",
    "222": "<i>The Grim Reaper<\/i>—Sinners call me that. I... like that name.",
    "223": "This body once had a soul. Her memories and her name have been devoured by the abyss. I\\'m not her... I\\'m just the remains of her.",
    "224": "Having a body like this... has its merits too. If I hadn\\'t been infected, I wouldn\\'t even have been able to walk normally.",
    "225": "I still remember the sun rising in the east, sunlight shining in through the window, onto me. That was the moment I looked forward to the most. When... did this memory happen?",
    "226": "For me, as long as you\\'re here, death... is no longer the only answer.",
    "227": "You make me aware of many... unfamiliar emotions. I look forward to your visit, I want to hear you talk, I want to see your smile. Is this a part of my forgotten past too? I want to... stay by your side.",
    "228": "Yes, I hear it... Are you in pain? Don\\'t worry... Soon you\\'ll be freed from it.",
    "229": "That\\'s useless. Since long ago, my body... hasn\\'t been able to feel anything.",
    "230": "Why are you willing to stay with... a monster like me?",
    "231": "I\\'m willing to roam the world for you.",
    "232": "Does this result satisfy your expectations?",
    "233": "Another step closer...",
    "234": "Don\\'t do that, it\\'s... dangerous for you.",
    "235": "I\\'ll relieve them of pain...",
    "236": "Danger!",
    "237": "Got it.",
    "238": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "239": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "240": "Is that...",
    "241": "Ahhh!",
    "242": "The stronger a Sinner... the closer they are to destruction...",
    "243": "Sunshine, chapel, and red flowers... make one so nostalgic... Strange. What is nostalgic?",
    "244": "Thank you, even though I have never prayed for strength.",
    "245": "Prayers have been answered... You are back.",
    "246": "Thank you for making me feel warm.",
    "247": "I know praying can\\'t bring me peace, but I had no other choice. Thankfully, you are here now.",
    "248": "When I walked in the DisSea, there wasn\\'t a second I did not pray to see the light of day. This chase gave me the strength to persevere.",
    "249": "I still remember that chapel near the DisSea where I could see sunlight. I loved it there... But I never found that place again after I left...",
    "250": "Do you prefer this look? I can stay like this forever if that\\'s what you want...",
    "251": "Please bring peace for them... for us...",
    "252": "Did you look for me... because of your unfulfilled wish? Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll pray for you.",
    "253": "I am NOX, the hunter of demons, the last of the Black Swords. Chosen one, tell me, do you too seek a final battle to seize that elusive dawn for humanity... If so, use me as your weapon!",
    "254": "This is a necessary power... and a necessary sacrifice.",
    "255": "Let\\'s set off. The sun has already risen. We\\'re running out of time.",
    "256": "Rest assured, I will not leave your side.",
    "257": "Born to be a special combat weapon, the Black Swords are pariahs mixed with demon blood. No matter which side prevails, there will be no place for us in this world.",
    "258": "Demons... are man-eating monsters that emerge from an unnamed darkness. Some of them may retain a human appearance, but don\\'t be fooled. Demons have no emotions and are only driven by insatiable hunger. Once you face them, you have no other choice but to fight.",
    "259": "Angel of Death... is that what they call me? What a shame. I\\'m no bloodless, tearless angel... With no wings, I can only crawl on the ground, yet I still yearn to look up at the sky.",
    "260": "The sunrise by the lake, the peaceful village... Those are the only memories I\\'ve kept since I became a Black Sword. The arrival of the demons tore everything apart, including my past...",
    "261": "The demon blood will eventually devour my sanity. Such is the fate of every Black Sword... When that day comes, please grant me peace... I don\\'t want to destroy everything I\\'ve protected.",
    "262": "Prayers don\\'t bring miracles, nor can they elicit mercy out of demons... Only fighting can grant us the right to live... Chosen one, I will be the sharp blade in your hands and I shall bring the last hope to you and all who struggle to survive!",
    "263": "Huh... Where are you taking me? Oh, food and lodging are included? Great! What\\'s my room number?",
    "264": "Hmm? You want to watch a film I made?",
    "265": "I will make everyone see me and respect me.",
    "266": "Lights, camera, action!",
    "267": "See? I\\'m still a professional.",
    "268": "Haha... I knew I\\'d ruin everything.",
    "269": "A good show is about to start!",
    "270": "In the end, I couldn\\'t leave anything behind...",
    "271": "You\\'re here, Chief? Are there any new movies on the rec room projector?",
    "272": "Oh, you\\'re here? Good timing. I found a movie that we can watch together.",
    "273": "What\\'s the sign of a successful film? Haha... The box in the office, of course...",
    "274": "You don\\'t get this film? It\\'s all the rage in Eastside, though...",
    "275": "OwO is a hardworking kid. She\\'ll definitely achieve her dreams.",
    "276": "Don\\'t fret over past mistakes. If you want to improve, keep moving forward.",
    "277": "No one\\'s life is perfect, but I can capture everyone\\'s most perfect moments. Here, show me a smile.",
    "278": "Flexibility is a trait of a mature adult... Of course, flexing too much will cause painful sprains.",
    "279": "The Legend of the Minos Hero... This might make a great film.",
    "280": "I want to record all those who refuse to accept fate, and immortalize their gazes and cries in film.",
    "281": "I may be weak, I may be mediocre, yet at certain moments, I can also be the hero.",
    "282": "Reality is a far cry from the beautiful scenes depicted in movies. Countless shining souls disappear in the blink of an eye, like shooting stars... If only I could catch one of them... What I mean is, to me, you\\'re a shining star, and the focal point of this world. Would you like to be the female lead of my film?",
    "283": "It\\'s nice to slack off and do nothing around here. The Chief will resolve everything anyways.",
    "284": "If you observe with your heart, the material for films will appear before your eyes.",
    "285": "Mmm, I\\'m not angry. Go on, don\\'t stop.",
    "286": "Hey, you have to pay first before telling a filmmaker what to do.",
    "287": "Whatever you want me to do, just tell me. I\\'ll do whatever you tell me to.",
    "288": "I\\'d rather you focus on my work than on me. Of course, I haven\\'t made any good ones yet, haha...",
    "289": "Yes, all right, okay, wait... for... me... to... come... back...",
    "290": "That was exhausting... There you go, that\\'s everything I got, no more no less... I\\'m gonna rest now! Don\\'t come find me again for at least... two days.",
    "291": "Aww, thank you so much...",
    "292": "Are you... complimenting my work?",
    "293": "Uh... Ok, fine. I\\'ll go, I\\'ll go.",
    "294": "Be careful...",
    "295": "All right...",
    "296": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "297": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "298": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "299": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "300": "Hmm? You want to watch a film I made?",
    "301": "Look up, slow down, and hold that smile. Don\\'t look at me, look at the camera... It\\'s okay, everyone gets nervous at first. But you, my chosen star, you\\'re destined to get used to this.",
    "302": "Emm, that\\'s right, keep up the praise! I can take it.",
    "303": "Oh come on, we\\'re already here. Stop being all fidgety. Or... are you waiting for me to help you out of the car?",
    "304": "Hey, we are under the spotlight... Aren\\'t you afraid our picture will end up on the front page of the entertainment section tomorrow? Haha, not that I mind.",
    "305": "While I was gone, they really hogged the limelight, didn\\'t they? Such a pity, I\\'m back now. Wait a bit longer, you might get a front-row seat to a spectacular show of these Eastside stars crying.",
    "306": "Word of advice, don\\'t eat the cake at the afterparty, it\\'s made of fondant. Looks pretty, but tastes awful... How do I know? Well, obviously because I\\'ve tried it.",
    "307": "I thought that I should\\'ve already gotten used to this by now, getting one more award won\\'t prove anything... But being back here is... unexpectedly exhilarating. Probably because you\\'re standing here with me.",
    "308": "Oh no... The zipper on my back seems to be open... It fit perfectly five years ago... Ugh, help me zip it quick. Don\\'t let them see!",
    "309": "If I\\'d known, I would\\'ve just arrived a lot later and let them wait. My face is all stiff from smiling...",
    "310": "Did you hear that? The spotlight will keep on shining, and the applause and cheers will never cease... Hmph, come on. Join me and we will become the center of the world\\'s attention.",
    "311": "Indeed, you\\'re not mistaken. It\\'s me, West District\\'s hero, Drifter Camp\\'s savior! Sigh, let\\'s save the rest for later. I\\'m starving, got any grub?",
    "312": "Is the situation that bleak? You must put even me under special training?",
    "313": "Who\\'d have thought my old spear would be given a second life... My, I\\'m getting emotional.",
    "314": "I\\'ll count to three. Surrender quickly, or I\\'ll get down and beg!",
    "315": "Surprised? You know what they say, don\\'t judge a book by its cover, heh heh.",
    "316": "Something\\'s not right... Time to run!",
    "317": "Enraged thunder!",
    "318": "Am I dying... Haha, it\\'s not like it\\'s the first time...",
    "319": "Oh, \\'sup. Fire away if you\\'re having any problems... Whether I can solve them is another matter.",
    "320": "We should definitely make a trip back on a less busy day. Imagine the faces of the folks at the Drifter Camp when they see me as your lapdog... Haha, it may not be shocking enough though, they\\'re used to it by now.",
    "321": "Remember, West District is a mixed bag. You never know who or what you\\'ll bump into, so don\\'t go picking fights all the time. You know that saying \\\\\"make friends, not enemies\\\\\", right? You might just need someone\\'s help one day, you hear me?",
    "322": "Speaking of which, you should be able to smooth things over for me with the Executive Committee, right? You know, what I\\'ve done could be considered as muting, and I don\\'t want them to pick on me. If you help me out this time, I\\'ll be forever in your debt... Pretty please!",
    "323": "This spear has been with me for a long time. The first time I picked it up, I was just a brash youngster who wanted to look cool. Over a decade has slipped by... How does that saying go? \\\\\"Things stay the same while people change.\\\\\" I never thought I would pick it up again... Cheer up, old buddy, don\\'t let us down.",
    "324": "West District can\\'t forget everything it\\'s been through... But rather than hatred and revenge, what we need and deserve is a future full of hope. The flame rekindles over the rust not to destroy, but to light up the way forward... Wow... How inspiring is that? Come on, praise me.",
    "325": "West District is gorgeous from this angle, isn\\'t it? It\\'s the way it should be. I still remember what it used to look like. On the sun-lit streets, when the wind blew through, there was no rusty smell. It was as warm as the sunlight, full of hope... Oh right, there\\'s a night market over there, it\\'s the closest thing to the old West District. When the sun sets and the stalls are up, I\\'ll take you there for a sniff.",
    "326": "Are they calling me \\\\\"Hero\\\\\"? Hehe, that\\'s nothing, I\\'ve had many titles. \\\\\"West District\\'s Brightest Star\\\\\", \\\\\"Thunder King\\\\\", \\\\\"Inner Bay\\'s Heartthrob\\\\\", \\\\\"Leader of Rustfire\\\\\", \\\\\"Deserter\\\\\", \\\\\"Traitor\\\\\", \\\\\"Liar\\\\\", \\\\\"Loser\\\\\", most of my titles are still being used, only one has been permanently forgotten... The person who used to call me \\\\\"Best Pal\\\\\" is no longer here... Hmm? What are you staring at me for? Huh? What do you want to say? No, no, nonono, I\\'m not ready for that, don\\'t call me that! Oh my god... Aren\\'t you embarrassed???",
    "327": "Rise and shine, sleeping beauty. Skipping work today?",
    "328": "What, you\\'re interested in my muscles? Bah, things have changed now. You need Sinner power to survive out there. Being beefy ain\\'t gonna scare anybody no more.",
    "329": "Oh, what brings the Chief of the MBCC here? What can a non-contributing member of society like me do for you?",
    "330": "Guarantee you the mission may not be accomplished.",
    "331": "Job\\'s done. When\\'s the commendation ceremony?",
    "332": "Alright, not bad, not bad.",
    "333": "Hey hey hey, stop messing with my hair. You\\'ve made it look like a bird\\'s nest. I\\'ve spent a lot of time perfecting this handsome look, you gonna fix it now?",
    "334": "So, you need me to show off my skills again? Okay, okay, I\\'ll be serious this time.",
    "335": "Shhh! I hear something!",
    "336": "You can count on me.",
    "337": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "338": "Ha!",
    "339": "Something\\'s off...",
    "340": "The fuck?",
    "341": "Is the situation that bleak? You must put even me under special training?",
    "342": "Is it you who summoned me? When the Sun Crow rises, crops scorch, plants wither, and the great famine follows... Mortal, be prepared.",
    "343": "Thank you... even though I can\\'t seem to recall anything.",
    "344": "The flaming feathers of the sunblaze shall shield the rivers for you.",
    "345": "May there be no suffering beings wherever I go.",
    "346": "Did I also, in the past... incinerate them in the flames?",
    "347": "Worry not... The Sun Crow doesn\\'t feel pain.",
    "348": "Solarfire!",
    "349": "This is... the destiny of calamity...",
    "350": "Is it the herald of sunrise? ...No, it\\'s you calling for me.",
    "351": "Legend has it that I popped out of a crack from the sun... Scary how words get around, I\\'m clearly a child of Mania... Ah, is it not appropriate to say that?",
    "352": "Hunger, poverty, and slaughter... burn like an endless wildfire... It must be hard for you, to walk alongside calamity.",
    "353": "Thank you for retrieving this body for me, and taking me to see this city untouched by disasters... The past me can finally rest when dusk comes.",
    "354": "Slightly plump temple, and a hint of redness in between your brows. These signs... Fear not, it\\'s a good omen.",
    "355": "Fear and faith coexist, I had to become a presence to be feared... If I had the chance to go back in time... I would be sure to have a long, heart-to-heart talk with you.",
    "356": "I was once worried that I couldn\\'t protect all beings, and I was afraid that the devoured me would bring new disasters... Now everything is fine, fortunately, because of you.",
    "357": "The next time ten suns appear in the sky, please promise me you will hold the bow. An arrow shot by someone of noble character, that\\'s where I belong.",
    "358": "Crimson clouds and scorching heat... I fear a disaster has descended! ...Oh, it\\'s just me.",
    "359": "The warmth of a human... If only I could touch you too.",
    "360": "It\\'s you? ...It\\'s rare to meet someone who has the courage to gaze directly at the sun.",
    "361": "A rare leisure stroll.",
    "362": "Is this the treasure of this mortal world? I... I\\'m familiar with it...",
    "363": "Illuminate... broader territories.",
    "364": "The glory of the sun cannot be obscured!",
    "365": "Turn into ashes...",
    "366": "Back off!",
    "367": "Understood.",
    "368": "Ha.",
    "369": "Heh!",
    "370": "Oh?",
    "371": "Hmph.",
    "372": "Thank you... even though I can\\'t seem to recall anything.",
    "373": "Alright, alright, I\\'ll indulge you with a little fun. After all... the way you\\'re trailing after me is just too adorable.",
    "374": "It\\'s only natural that the owner of Whitestone Industries is highly competent.",
    "375": "You\\'ve got to show what you\\'re made of once in a while. Am I right, Chief?",
    "376": "Come grab a drink with me when it\\'s done.",
    "377": "The job is done! Shall we sort out the pay?",
    "378": "When there\\'s a will, there\\'s a—which way is the exit?",
    "379": "You are all done for.",
    "380": "Take care of them... please...",
    "381": "MBCC\\'s Whitestone Branch at your service! If you drop by, I\\'ll offer you a special 20% off. Shush... don\\'t let K.K. know.",
    "382": "Time for bed. I\\'ve earned it, haven\\'t I? I\\'ve been working <i>so hard<\/i> for you, Chief.",
    "383": "I\\'m faster than lightning when I want to be. You won\\'t be able to stop me. Hmm, you think I\\'m bluffing? Try setting me free and see for yourself then.",
    "384": "Whitestone is able to survive in Syndicate till today because I\\'ve poured my blood, sweat, and tears into this company. You really can\\'t count on those two kids, for heaven\\'s sake... Why are you looking at me like this? Am I not speaking the truth?",
    "385": "I don\\'t have any virtuous faith. I\\'m happy enough to be able to protect those around me. I don\\'t want to lose anyone ever again.",
    "386": "Half of those <i>scan code and save 10 DisCoins on your order<\/i> ads in the city are posted by me. I\\'ve been to every corner of the DisCity, and I know about the things you want to investigate. Wanna hear it? ...Well, pay up!",
    "387": "Underground city? Why on earth are you always looking into this sort of thing... Has anyone seen it? If no one has seen it, that means it\\'s fake. Or... no one who\\'s entered it has made it out alive.",
    "388": "I don\\'t like working hard, but I do like hard-working people. People like K.K., Che... and you. Trust me, your hard effort won\\'t go to waste—I won\\'t let that happen.",
    "389": "The meals here are pretty good. I don\\'t need to repay my debts here. Also, the landlord can\\'t just barge in. Nice, nice... It\\'s decided, I\\'m not leaving!",
    "390": "Oh? How unusual. Are you taking the lead today? In that case, let\\'s have some fun...",
    "391": "Are you so eager to be close to me? Oh my, such an honest kid.",
    "392": "Does this count as a job? You know the drill, I don\\'t work for free.",
    "393": "Phew... Should have asked K.K. to settle this for me...",
    "394": "Whatever you say, whatever you need.",
    "395": "Handsy. Fancy going for a ride with me, Chief?",
    "396": "Oh? Try to keep up with me, you guys.",
    "397": "Danger!",
    "398": "Mmm.",
    "399": "(Grunts)",
    "400": "(Bellows)",
    "401": "Hmm?",
    "402": "Huh?!",
    "403": "It\\'s only natural that the owner of Whitestone Industries is highly competent.",
    "404": "So you finally found out. Don\\'t be shocked. Syndicate has quite a few dank rats lurking in the dark. Someone\\'s got to deal with them. It\\'s really no trouble for me.",
    "405": "The faster the blade, the fewer problems there are.",
    "406": "You\\'re finally back. I stayed here and didn\\'t go out all this time when you were gone... Oh, you want to know about the stain on my cloak? Che accidentally spilled water on it. Yeah, that must be it.",
    "407": "These hair accessories all have their own purposes. Be careful not to cut your hands.",
    "408": "Errands? What errands would a decent person have this late... I simply enjoy walking around at night. Yup, that\\'s all.",
    "409": "There is a restaurant nearby. Their braised beef goes well with wine. Let\\'s grab a drink together?",
    "410": "With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb\\'st in the skies... What a beautiful night to sweep away vice.",
    "411": "If you slash a blade fast enough, an afterimage will linger in its place. Beautiful, isn\\'t it?",
    "412": "Hmm, this familiar stench... Is it coming from over there?",
    "413": "Is this meant to... surveil me? Which do you think is faster, the speed of my movement or the blink of your eye?",
    "414": "Believe me, I\\'ve really been to the sea! I chartered a luxury yacht and found a lot of treasures there... (Chuckles) K.K. and Che were there, too! They can vouch for me!",
    "415": "Hehe, afterwards, I found even more treasures.",
    "416": "Done resting? Let\\'s head out, then. There are still lots of treasures at the bottom of the sea waiting for us to salvage.",
    "417": "When you\\'re alone on a boat with a hot babe like me, your imagination is bound to run wild. It\\'s fine, I forgive you.",
    "418": "You know, my boat back then was unparalleled. Powerful, luxurious, and decked out with every gadget you can possibly imagine... What\\'s that look? Don\\'t believe that I used to be rich?",
    "419": "It can get dangerous at times on the sea. There are storms, pirates, and sharks. But fear not. To me, those are just little hiccups on the road to fortune.",
    "420": "Can I swim? Ha! I can swim like a little mermaid, so fast, so graceful! Anyone sees that should pay me. You\\'ll understand once I get into the water.",
    "421": "Phew, the sun is scorching. I\\'m getting all hot and sweaty... Aww, how come you\\'re blushing?",
    "422": "Ah... Take a nap on the deck if you\\'re tired. The sun is so warm, and the sea breeze feels so nice...",
    "423": "All right, all hands on deck. We\\'re heading to deeper waters!",
    "424": "Just as glass can\\'t trap a shadow, this can\\'t trap me. Stop wasting your effort, Chief of Minos. You adults only ever make things worse.",
    "425": "No one will find me as long as I don\\'t expose myself to sunlight.",
    "426": "Every inch of shadow in the DisCity belongs to me.",
    "427": "Kids shouldn\\'t be in this kind of place.",
    "428": "You want me to deal with... this?",
    "429": "Haha, I knew it. Nothing will change.",
    "430": "Shadow... follows.",
    "431": "It\\'s so dark... so cold...",
    "432": "Chief of Minos, please be aware of the shadow in the room. You almost ran into me.",
    "433": "I have nothing to do with the troubles caused by \\\\\"the Homeless.\\\\\" I\\'m not the leader and didn\\'t give any orders. They\\'re just using my name. But... are the naughty kids in Syndicate giving you a headache? Haha. You get what you deserve.",
    "434": "You\\'re a mature adult. What help can a kid give you?",
    "435": "No one wants to be born in Syndicate, where lies and violence always prevail. I have given up. It isn\\'t too much to ask to want to stay away, right?",
    "436": "It... isn\\'t too bad here. The bed in the bedroom is much softer than the one in Syndicate.",
    "437": "That on the wall is the emblem of \\\\\"the Homeless.\\\\\" If you wish to join, just draw one yourself... but you\\'re not qualified just from age alone.",
    "438": "Can the space for Sinners be expanded somewhat? It\\'s not that I hate cramped spaces. It just... reminds me of bad memories. Or... perhaps... you can keep me company for a bit.",
    "439": "You... are a strange adult. If all the adults in Syndicate were like you, I guess we would suffer a lot less ...Why didn\\'t you come sooner...",
    "440": "Ah—a time to relax, finally. No mission and no one to bother me.",
    "441": "...Do all you adults like doing this?",
    "442": "...When you gaze at the shadows, the shadows are gazing back at you. Your gaze is very intense.",
    "443": "Huh? I have to work here?",
    "444": "Cough... I knew I wasn\\'t used to moving about under the sun...",
    "445": "The shadows... are gathering toward me.",
    "446": "No! ...It\\'ll stunt height growth.",
    "447": "What a pain... If I must be on the field, let\\'s end the battle quickly.",
    "448": "The situation... has changed slightly.",
    "449": "You better not make a mistake.",
    "450": "(Grunts)",
    "451": "(Bellows half-heartedly)",
    "452": "Hmm?",
    "453": "Hiss...",
    "454": "No one will find me as long as I don\\'t expose myself to sunlight.",
    "455": "Are you still listening to those corny stories? Take a good look at what our \\\\\"fairy tales\\\\\" really look like...",
    "456": "Shadow, do you smell that rotting, bloody stench... It\\'s time to eat.",
    "457": "Hey, stay here and don\\'t go out. In the forest... even someone like you will be gobbled up like a little rabbit.",
    "458": "Ears, shadows, eyes... Still don\\'t understand? I\\'m not some red-hooded kid who gets bullied so easily.",
    "459": "Those bastards use fairy tales to trick kids into being kind. Then they exploit their kindness, hurt them, and finally discard them like trash... I won\\'t be fooled anymore.",
    "460": "Do you really believe the Big Bad Wolf will spit out meat that\\'s already in his mouth? He will only take bite after bite until the prey is completely eaten.",
    "461": "You want some \\\\\"Little Red Riding Hood\\\\\" cookies too? Sure, but... don\\'t ask what they\\'re made of.",
    "462": "No one would give up their prey to a little girl in a dress. You\\'d have to be stronger than they are.",
    "463": "Shush, wait a bit longer, the night is still young... We belong to the depths of darkness.",
    "464": "Don\\'t get your hopes up. I won\\'t play house with you.",
    "465": "Are you trying to take me home? Hehehe... if you treat me as a pet, it won\\'t end well...",
    "466": "Hmm... this reminds me of the ouroboros.",
    "467": "I will... wrap around you tightly...",
    "468": "I\\'ve locked onto my target prey, hiss...",
    "469": "Thank you for making me feel that I am still alive.",
    "470": "Haha... pain is a reassuring sensation.",
    "471": "This ends here. You will thank me later.",
    "472": "Do I feel... happy?",
    "473": "Ah, a rare guest! You\\'re here to see me again?",
    "474": "I\\'m neither human nor monster, hmm... I think I might be a venomous snake?",
    "475": "Will I get poisoned if I bite my own tongue...? You\\'re so funny. It\\'s as if snake venom got into your head.",
    "476": "Everyone has the right to laugh. Whoever takes it away will go to hell.",
    "477": "I can understand that some people don\\'t like snakes, so you can also understand that I don\\'t like some people, right?",
    "478": "Misery is the culprit that destroys laughter, but also heralds the birth of a new world. What do you think?",
    "479": "I love the way you smile, and it\\'s even better if it\\'s because of me.",
    "480": "Can you give me a hug? Your temperature reminds me of spring, the time of awakening, the season of rebirth... I can hear our hearts beating together.",
    "481": "It\\'s so quiet... it\\'s as if the end of the world is nigh. Looks like I\\'ll be able to get a good night\\'s sleep.",
    "482": "Hmm... seems like you want me to take a bite of you?",
    "483": "To look for one leaf in an entire forest... to lock onto one monster in an entire herd... you really have a lot of energy.",
    "484": "If this can cheer you up...",
    "485": "Did you like this performance?",
    "486": "Hope you have fun...",
    "487": "The hero pierced the snake\\'s cranium with his sword, beheading the monstrous serpent. You know where the cranium is? You just touched it.",
    "488": "Today\\'s performance is about to start! Get ready to laugh your head off...",
    "489": "Be careful...",
    "490": "Yes yes yes...",
    "491": "Tsk... Ah!",
    "492": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "493": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "494": "Hmm?",
    "495": "Hmm... this reminds me of the ouroboros.",
    "496": "I had a long dream, a dream of pursuing happiness, a dream of... rebirth.",
    "497": "Mmm... Just a little bit longer...",
    "498": "Oh... It\\'s spring already? I\\'ll get up then... Give me two more minutes...",
    "499": "Your hand\\'s... still so warm...",
    "500": "The sheets are so warm... Chief, if you can join me up here... I\\'ll be very happy...",
    "501": "I can\\'t miss this festive holiday... But I need some more time to prepare...",
    "502": "No one can take away my... my blankets... Take away my Chief... Hehe... Snore... Snore...",
    "503": "Mmm... Time for spring cleaning? But my place is quite tidy already... Or do you want to help me?",
    "504": "Sigh... The fireworks outside... really disturb my dreams...",
    "505": "My gosh, I\\'m almost done dressing! If you keep rushing me... I\\'ll bite you!",
    "506": "Commissioner, I heard that apart from food, this place also sells a drink that brings unlimited happiness! It\\'s true!",
    "507": "Yes. ...... It\\'s true to its name. ......",
    "508": "Chief, I\\'ve ordered a set menu for two. Come spend some happy time with me.",
    "509": "I\\'m always asked to control my diet when I\\'m at work, and many times my dinner consists of one cookie ...... Experiences like today\\'s are probably only found in the hallucinatory dreams that Marv creates.",
    "510": "The act of putting ice into a drink is nothing short of genius-like creation! Especially when the weather is hot! Taking a sip of ...... ah...... ice cold, it\\'s such a reassuring feeling ......",
    "511": "Huh, where\\'s my happiness ...... Why is it gone so quickly ...... Sure enough, even if I\\'m not in Dis City, is happiness so short-lived ......",
    "512": "What\\'s wrong? Do you want this cup in my hand ...... Oh, of course, I don\\'t mind sharing my happiness with you, Director...",
    "513": "Now that we\\'re here, we might as well enjoy our time until we find out what\\'s going on, don\\'t you think so, dear Director?",
    "514": "Glad to see you again, Chief. Do you want me to trim your hair, or trim away your troubles?",
    "515": "Your recognition is the best reward I could ever ask for.",
    "516": "A thick fog rolls in. The eyes of a lurker lock onto its prey... Shh, don\\'t look back, it\\'s staring right at you...",
    "517": "Ah... the fog is coming in.",
    "518": "All done. Look forward to seeing you again.",
    "519": "Are you not happy with my service?",
    "520": "Shh... I found you.",
    "521": "I can\\'t let it end here...",
    "522": "Welcome. Though we\\'re not in the salon right now, I\\'m still open to every customer\\'s needs.",
    "523": "Every customer who comes to my salon is troubled by something, and I happen to enjoy getting rid of those troubles for them.",
    "524": "\\\\\"Hair is like troubles. Cut them to lose all the worries,\\\\\" someone once told me that. You are welcome to my humble salon anytime to refresh your mood.",
    "525": "You sharpened my scissors but forbid me to remove people\\'s troubles. Chief, how should I interpret your behavior?",
    "526": "Don\\'t worry. Most people will never recall the things that have been troubling them. They\\'ll think of it as a dream. The fog disperses, and the dream ends.",
    "527": "Everyone loves Adela the hairdresser and fears the figure in thick fog. Sigh... If my service has become an annoyance, then I\\'ll just have to help them forget all of this.",
    "528": "Are you wondering who\\'s behind the tale of fog alley, too? Is it a good Samaritan who rid people of their troubles, or a freak who relishes destroying and cutting things? Or maybe both?",
    "529": "People tend to bury themselves with old troubling memories, overburdened and suffocated, so I cut it away from me. But little did I know that I also cut away something that allowed my heart to sing. It\\'s you who helped me rediscover that something.",
    "530": "Scissors will rust if left unused for a long time.",
    "531": "Hmm? It seems that you have something that is troubling you. Sit still. Let me cut it off for you...",
    "532": "Is this your way of saying you want to keep me by your side, like, forever?",
    "533": "I\\'m honored to be of assistance.",
    "534": "It\\'s my pleasure. Are you satisfied with the results?",
    "535": "Thank you. How can I ever repay you?",
    "536": "You like my hairstyle? This is very popular in Eastside. If you want to have this haircut, (Chuckles)... perhaps you need to let your hair grow for a while.",
    "537": "At your service.",
    "538": "Watch out!",
    "539": "Sure, consider it done.",
    "540": "(Grunts)",
    "541": "Uses her scissors to attack",
    "542": "(Chuckles)",
    "543": "Ah!",
    "544": "Your recognition is the best reward I could ever ask for.",
    "545": "You smell... unfamiliar, different from theirs... Stay calm, don\\'t give in, I\\'ll be right there to help you...",
    "546": "You like it? This new, more powerful form of mine.",
    "547": "There are limits to how much one can mutate... I did it! I must jot this down...",
    "548": "Poor little thing ... Rest in peace...",
    "549": "It\\'s just the natural order, the strong prey on the weak.",
    "550": "Don\\'t beat yourself up... Sometimes, running away is also an excellent survival strategy.",
    "551": "Gotcha!",
    "552": "Ahhhhhhh!",
    "553": "A familiar scent... I knew it was you! I\\'ve been longing for your return... Can you take me away from this place? I hate being caged here...",
    "554": "You seem to work so hard... Here, try this. It\\'s good, tastes like... chicken. It can provide you with proteins and fats.",
    "555": "You smell... so good... Can I get a bit closer to you?",
    "556": "I never wanted to eat it... eat them... I was just... too hungry...",
    "557": "There are so many out there who need help... I think you should look out for them instead of always worrying about me. I can... deal with my own business...",
    "558": "All anomalies... stem from humanity... from within our very souls... They aren\\'t monsters... They\\'re fragments of who we are...",
    "559": "Fear not... If you ever lose your way or encounter danger, I promise, I\\'ll be right there for you... I never leave my companions behind, I swear...",
    "560": "I thought I was here to rescue you, but it was you... who saved me. I\\'m sorry for being such a burden and causing so much chaos... Thank you...",
    "561": "Did you manage to light up our friends day?... Have you done your share of job?... Were you... able to rescue them?",
    "562": "Hmm? ...Is this the courtship ritual of some animal?",
    "563": "You don\\'t have to come and find me... I remember your scent. I can track you down myself.",
    "564": "What can I... do for you?",
    "565": "This adventure has brought so many new discoveries.",
    "566": "Must... adjust to the changing environment.",
    "567": "But... what you\\'re doing is meaningless... With this Chitin exterior... I can\\'t feel your patting...",
    "568": "Looks like... someone\\'s about to be preyed on...",
    "569": "Don\\'t be afraid.",
    "570": "Let me handle this.",
    "571": "Grunts",
    "572": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "573": "Hehe...",
    "574": "Eh?",
    "575": "You like it? This new, more powerful form of mine.",
    "576": "MBCC\\'s technology is kind of lagging behind, Chief. How can you expect to jail me with this kind of equipment? Why don\\'t you do a system upgrade? I can get it done for you in the blink of an eye.",
    "577": "<i>Here comes the hero!<\/i> Ahem... How did I do? I\\'ve been wanting to say that line for a while.",
    "578": "Controller center is successfully connected. Summer is ready. Time to go save this dark world!",
    "579": "My skirt will get dirty in this kind of place.",
    "580": "<i>Evil will eventually be vanquished.<\/i> Hmm... That\\'s a pretty sick line too.",
    "581": "Aargh... There must have been something wrong with the Ring Weapon\\'s parameter settings. Let\\'s try one more time!",
    "582": "Full system locked on, clear area!",
    "583": "No... I haven\\'t even had... my graduation...",
    "584": "Hi, Chief! While you were away, I came up with a new idea... Have you ever thought about replacing an arm or a leg with a more functional one? Or maybe... upgrading your brain?",
    "585": "Watch closely. This is the <i>Ring Weapon<\/i>, not a <i>Mania weapon<\/i>. They are fundamentally different. Give me a break. How could I possibly make an inferior product like that?",
    "586": "A scientific genius needs loads of sugar to sustain her thinking, and chocolate is the best choice. What\\'s more, it\\'s a perfect match for a high school girl. What I\\'m trying to say is that... Can you approve my purchase application already? I promise to give you some!",
    "587": "The only weakness of that robot is its looks! It\\'s different from those common models! Stop mocking it, or I\\'m gonna get mad. And apologize to the model!",
    "588": "Friends? I don\\'t need them. Who says high school girls must have friends? Don\\'t you think <i>weird, gorgeous, mysterious robot-geek genius at school<\/i> works better as a character concept?",
    "589": "This place is like heaven compared to the Ring Research Institute! I can decorate my room as I like and set my schedule freely. Above all, I can watch anime anytime and anywhere I want!",
    "590": "It sucks having to go into battle myself. My skirt has gotten dirty a few times. But seeing as it\\'s your request... Alright, I\\'ll do it for you. In return, you\\'ll be my test subject for a day, deal?",
    "591": "I\\'ve noticed there have been a few moments when you looked pretty heroic... Hey, are you interested in becoming a giant robot pilot? I already have a rough design in mind!",
    "592": "Let\\'s begin today\\'s workout routine! Breathe in, breathe out. Awesome! What a perfect diaphragmatic breathing exercise. Goal reached. Time to head back and eat some ice cream, woo-hoo!",
    "593": "No workout today... Let me be a couch potato for just one day...",
    "594": "Are you curious about me? Hehe, I want to observe you closely too.",
    "595": "Eh... I\\'ve got an errand to run?",
    "596": "If it weren\\'t for the Ring Weapon... I would have died of exhaustion...",
    "597": "Sugar, replenished!",
    "598": "Hmm? What is it? You didn\\'t fully grasp the topic I explained just now? Well, well... If it\\'s for you, I can repeat it as many times as you want.",
    "599": "I\\'m ready anytime!",
    "600": "Ah!",
    "601": "Got it!",
    "602": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "603": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "604": "Eh?",
    "605": "W-what?",
    "606": "<i>Here comes the hero!<\/i> Ahem... How did I do? I\\'ve been wanting to say that line for a while.",
    "607": "\\\\\"You want my treasure? Then find it in WhiteSands!\\\\\" Hehe, what do you think?! Isn\\'t this line perfect in this situation?",
    "608": "Mechanical sequence optimized!",
    "609": "The claw strength is up to standard. Let me try them on the Chief! Ahem... Morning, Chief! Wanna go experiment... explore WhiteSands?",
    "610": "Oh? Wanna try this too? Ha, looks like you can\\'t resist the charm of this \\\\\"Summer\\'s special sand-proof hat\\\\\" either, Chief.",
    "611": "The ritual of treasure hunting should come first, of course! ...I don\\'t think it\\'s too hot to wear this much! Do you not believe in the 30 cooling modules installed in the clothes?!",
    "612": "Chocolate—Chocolate—Hmm? There\\'s none left... I can\\'t believe it\\'s gone so fast! Sigh, I should\\'ve brought more.",
    "613": "If you put a propeller on your head, then a solar panel and steering system, and finally a battery, you can replace my drone and become the most intelligent detector in WhiteSands! So? Wanna try?",
    "614": "Ah... Let me rest for a bit... I just finished checking the power system of the sand boat... I\\'m too tired to move...",
    "615": "Wow... what a ferocious sandstorm!",
    "616": "Huh? Why, it\\'s Chief! Look at you... Are you here to find the treasure buried in WhiteSands?",
    "617": "Ring substance engine pressure, check. Electronics and navigation system, check. Exterior, check. Enhanced Ring weapon for air combat, Summer 1... Lift off!",
    "618": "For the blue and pure sky!",
    "619": "How are you feeling, Chief? Isn\\'t it just awesome to fly around in the sky?",
    "620": "I wanted to make this back when I was at the Ring Research Institute! But those old geezers kept turning me down, saying they didn\\'t have enough budget. Hehe, but I know Chief is the best!",
    "621": "Woohoo! It\\'s working pretty well! We\\'re gonna make it to their prom on time.",
    "622": "Um? New message. \\\\\"Keep an eye on the altitude. Be careful not to damage the equipment.\\\\\" Come on, give me some credit.",
    "623": "Of course I warmed up before the test flight. I\\'ve done two whole sit-ups!",
    "624": "You say the armor is not thick enough? Hehe... won\\'t be a problem, as long as we don\\'t get hit.",
    "625": "Um... Vegetables and fruits grown from seeds that went to space can be unusually large. Chief, do you think it\\'s possible that cocoa made from beans that went to space tastes sweeter? Hehehe...",
    "626": "Alas, just relax, Chief! There are sixteen smart flight modules built into your gear. You could take a long nap in the mid air, and still wouldn\\'t have to worry about falling to the ground.",
    "627": "Handcuffing your own boss... You\\'ve got balls, rookie. Come on then, show me what you have on me.",
    "628": "Careful—You\\'re in my crosshairs.",
    "629": "You don\\'t deserve to see sunlight, filthy sewer scum!",
    "630": "Let me see how you flee like rats.",
    "631": "Good job. Let\\'s go back and celebrate.",
    "632": "Retreat. I can\\'t waste the valuable lives of my subordinates here.",
    "633": "Time to die.",
    "634": "Somebody... will carry on this will...",
    "635": "You\\'re late, rookie. Any progress on the mission?",
    "636": "Do you like my cane? I\\'ll let you borrow it. Beware though, there are quite a few hidden parts inside... Don\\'t injure yourself.",
    "637": "Crawl into darkness, bloody your hands... My subordinates do not need justice. Loyalty is their greatest virtue.",
    "638": "What do they call the 9th Agency? A bunch of spiders in the shadows, a gang of merciless lackeys? Hmm... I like that. Their hatred comes from fear, and fear... is the favorite weapon of spies.",
    "639": "Don\\'t stress over the protocol. You have free rein to do whatever you see fit. Be confident. You work under me.",
    "640": "I wish... for world peace. Can you believe it?",
    "641": "Are you curious about this little accessory on my temple? You don\\'t have to know what it is. It\\'s nothing more than... my occasional vanity.",
    "642": "Never ask me for truths, rookie. Some truths can only be traded for with blood. Some day, I\\'ll carry them to the grave. As for you... you\\'ll live on. I\\'ll let you live on, with my city, through the dark night, into the dawn of a new day.",
    "643": "Hmm... Who should I get rid of next?",
    "644": "Are you sure? Losing your job and losing your life are both rather inconvenient consequences.",
    "645": "Just staring at me won\\'t get you the intelligence you\\'re after. What, need me to teach you some torture skills, rookie?",
    "646": "Oh? You want me to tend to this matter personally?",
    "647": "Want <i>firsthand<\/i> intelligence? Come get it in my office tonight.",
    "648": "Target—locked on.",
    "649": "Wanna try on this hat, or try my bullets?",
    "650": "Execution time.",
    "651": "Watch it.",
    "652": "Okay.",
    "653": "Hmph.",
    "654": "(Cries out)",
    "655": "Oh?",
    "656": "...",
    "657": "Careful—You\\'re in my crosshairs.",
    "658": "Everything is progressing smoothly. But I must say, your presence... makes this party even more interesting.",
    "659": "Let me enjoy this party even more.",
    "660": "I don\\'t want to hear your report. That\\'s for tomorrow. Enjoy the party—that\\'s the most important task at hand.",
    "661": "Prairie gentian, yellow iris, camellia... Which flower shall I adorn my hair with?",
    "662": "You came too early, rookie. Is it because you don\\'t trust me, or... you want to watch me complete the mission with your own eyes? I hope your answer is the latter.",
    "663": "Looks clear but tastes zesty—this is what\\'s special about Mitsumasa, the liquor that Kenichi Yagyu is most proud of. Just like Syndicate gangs... seemingly innocuous on the surface, but with sharp blades hidden underneath. Don\\'t you think so, rookie?",
    "664": "Some truths can only be exchanged for blood, but this time... I don\\'t want to make too much of a ruckus.",
    "665": "Don\\'t be so nervous, rookie. You won\\'t get any intelligence with that sullen face... Come, sit and have a drink with me. Show some respect to this party and its host by enjoying it.",
    "666": "Please give my friend a glass of orange juice—she can\\'t handle such a strong drink.",
    "667": "All the intelligence is here. If you want it, come and stay with me after the party... to sort out the information, of course.",
    "668": "Well, it seems that scurvy didn\\'t take you down. That\\'s my first mate for you. Now, everyone, back to your stations. Hoist the anchor, and raise the sails. The \\\\\"Madame Maelstrom\\\\\" is setting sail again!",
    "669": "This ship could use all the extra firepower we can get.",
    "670": "You\\'re awake, first mate. Still savoring the aftertaste of yesterday\\'s revelry? Relax, I\\'m not accusing you. Obey orders, enjoy yourself, and fight to your heart\\'s content... These are the only rules on this \\\\\"Madame Maelstrom\\\\\".",
    "671": "Great. Feed \\'em to the sharks.",
    "672": "City... special agency... the 9th Agency? What are you yapping about? Chef, there\\'s something off with that barrel of tequila. Dump it all into the sea.",
    "673": "The storm\\'s brewing. First mate, tell the crew to change course for the nearest safe harbor... Save our courage for the enemies. There\\'s no point in fighting the sea itself... It will get you nothing but a broken mast.",
    "674": "Paradeisos? Don\\'t worry, they won\\'t bother me... You want to know about my relationship with them? Well, those who know that secret are either on the throne or at the bottom of the sea. Which one do you plan to be?",
    "675": "One of these days, I\\'ll hand over this hat, along with this ship, to you. But before that, you\\'ve got to prove your worth. Understood?",
    "676": "Dare slack off and nap in front of your captain? You\\'re bold, my dear first mate.",
    "677": "Welcome back, my first mate. How are things on that island? How many are stationed there? How many cannons do they have? Excellent scouting. Seems like our prey is about to show its weak spot.",
    "678": "I\\'d rather chat with you in the cemetery than in the interrogation room... you lie inside while I sit outside. I think our chat will be much better that way.",
    "679": "Shhh... I hear their whispers.",
    "680": "Want to join... our tea party?",
    "681": "Did you hear the bell tolling? The ceremony is about to begin.",
    "682": "Don\\'t worry, the elegy is already playing.",
    "683": "It\\'s okay, its not time for eternal sleep yet.",
    "684": "Rest for eternity!",
    "685": "Everyone... eventually ends up in an oaken casket...",
    "686": "Hello Chief. Let us both celebrate and mourn the fact that we are still alive today.",
    "687": "If you need a band... go find a musician named Dudu. Mention my name and maybe she\\'ll give you a discount.",
    "688": "Syndicate needed a grand farewell to usher in another perfect rebirth.",
    "689": "Rest beneath the ground, glide with the wind, or drift along the tide? It doesn\\'t really matter, my friend. They are just one necessary step to salvation.",
    "690": "Those who\\'re inside caskets do not pine for the weeping of mourners. Their tears will only wash away the last of their traces and drown out their cries.",
    "691": "Only when there is an eternity of silence, the stupidity, boredom, and vileness of life will be changed into something intriguing... However, there is something different about you.",
    "692": "I cannot personally preside over my own funeral, but I will leave you my last word. Will you accept it?",
    "693": "You intrigue me more than the dead. Please forgive me for burdening you with my darkness, loneliness, and desperation... Even upon death, I will stay by your side.",
    "694": "Pray? I don\\'t do such... useless things.",
    "695": "Do you like me this much? Too bad I can\\'t blow fragile bubbles inside my skull.",
    "696": "What do you see through my eyes?",
    "697": "Want to go for a walk in the cemetery with me?",
    "698": "Hmm, yes... I heard a lot of little secrets.",
    "699": "I can tell that you really need me.",
    "700": "Skulls typically hold the most information because human brains tend to think about their unsettled business upon death.",
    "701": "Got to face that boring, breathing bunch again...",
    "702": "Oh? Things are getting interesting...",
    "703": "Okay.",
    "704": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "705": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "706": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "707": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "708": "Shhh... I hear their whispers.",
    "709": "Since the moment you stepped into the forest, you\\'ve belonged to me. I shall grant you eternal slumber. As for me, I will get everything I want.",
    "710": "I shall give you riper fruit.",
    "711": "Good, come and eat the fruit I offer you... You\\'ll receive the sweetest salvation.",
    "712": "The rainbow has seven colors, and God created the world in seven days. The seven gems on my crown allow me to hear discarnate whispers. If that\\'s also what you want... come and try to snatch my crown.",
    "713": "Someone once presented me with a magic mirror that speaks only the truth. Guess whose existence I discovered from its mouth?",
    "714": "I\\'m not the ruler of this place. I simply provide lost travelers with a place to rest forever.",
    "715": "Snow covers tracks, apples arouse desires, and ebony safeguards secrets... What do you wish to decorate your resting place with?",
    "716": "Close your eyes, and you shall see the boundless darkness of the forbidden forest... But fear not. Give me your hand, and I shall take you to where you ought to be.",
    "717": "This forest is not silent. After all, they have been talking to me from six feet under.",
    "718": "Since you\\'re so curious about me... stay and become part of my collection.",
    "719": "The crimson full moon rises... You used the unknown to catch me... You... are the black hole of secrets I long for.",
    "720": "Have you... solved the inscrutable riddle about me?",
    "721": "Break all the shackles and peer into my deepest secrets.",
    "722": "There\\'s nothing I wish to seek here.",
    "723": "This mission... might be worth something, but barely...",
    "724": "This mission has become meaningless. Don\\'t waste any more time...",
    "725": "The red heat shall devour everything!",
    "726": "The stars... shall ultimately die in darkness.",
    "727": "No, no... Argh! I-is that you? Oh good... you came.",
    "728": "I want... I want to unearth all the unknowns of the world, and watch as 100 billion suns collapse into black holes of doom...",
    "729": "Quick... hurry. Let me go seek and explore and research and devour all the secrets... until they completely vanish from my consciousness.",
    "730": "It\\'s howling and tormenting me... and pushing me to get all your secrets...",
    "731": "Me...? I survived by devouring secrets of the unknown... Yeah, that\\'s all...",
    "732": "I shall always remember... how that red star fell into the sea... It brought forth endless knowledge, secrets, affairs and mysteries... Ah, how intriguing it is.",
    "733": "I went to that place in search of the unknown... It really satisfies me, but I think, you can make me feel the same way.",
    "734": "Quantum fields attract and distort space-time, while you and your secrets... attract me... I can\\'t help but be drawn to you, and fall... I cannot escape, yet... I have no regrets.",
    "735": "Instead of lingering by my side, why not come a bit closer...",
    "736": "No need to tell me what this move means... I don\\'t want to know.",
    "737": "It\\'s extremely dangerous to gaze at the Black Hole... It won\\'t respond to you. It\\'ll just rip you apart and devour you...",
    "738": "I don\\'t want to be too far away from you.",
    "739": "The things that are already known to humans are worthless.",
    "740": "Push the limits.",
    "741": "Do you also want to break through mankind\\'s greatest defenses and peek into their secrets?",
    "742": "If you want to use me, be careful.",
    "743": "Be careful.",
    "744": "Got it.",
    "745": "Grunts",
    "746": "Hey.",
    "747": "Hmm...",
    "748": "Oh.",
    "749": "Have you... solved the inscrutable riddle about me?",
    "750": "This is a gathering of the stars... In this vast emptiness, the only ones attending the feast are me... and you...",
    "751": "The more the stars burn, the brighter they shine...",
    "752": "Climb up the stairs and join me... If you stop just for these bouquets, you\\'ll miss out on the spectacular view of the starry sky...",
    "753": "That celestial body encircling us is the mere shadow of the same star... A black hole hides it well by warping and refracting the light... But now, I\\'ll guide you to fully perceive its existence.",
    "754": "The stars converge in the cosmos, and I yearn to uncover all their secrets... Even if it means becoming one of them, torn apart for closing the distance... I simply can\\'t resist...",
    "755": "It\\'s getting closer... The red full moon...",
    "756": "If you wish to get closer to me, instead of tangling with my hem, why don\\'t you... tell me your secrets.",
    "757": "Are you looking upon this sea of stars... or are you looking... at me?",
    "758": "It must have been very hard on you, you poor thing. You\\'ve done well. I\\'ll take it from here, and everything will be all right.",
    "759": "Not satisfied with my performance? I should work harder in the future? Sure, if it\\'s what you want me to do.",
    "760": "Okay, that\\'s enough, you\\'ve traveled too far. Go back, before it\\'s too late.",
    "761": "You want me to come along? Sure. I\\'d be glad to go with you.",
    "762": "My work here is done. I wish you good luck.",
    "763": "It\\'s all right. Just a little mistake. I\\'m an expert at fixing things.",
    "764": "Too noisy. Quiet!",
    "765": "Heh, I\\'ll take my leave... See you on the other side...",
    "766": "Hello there, ready for the busy day ahead? Do you need my help, or do you want my encouragement instead?",
    "767": "My job is to fix mistakes. I receive requests for help, analyze the situation, formulate plans, and execute them. I don\\'t hate this job. It\\'s just... many unnecessary costs could be avoided if everybody acted more cautiously. My point is, you should be cautious out there, Chief. I hope that you will never require my services as the \\\\\"Hush.\\\\\"",
    "768": "I\\'m neither a good fighter, nor do I have any special powers. The only thing that protects me from harm is my Schorl. Of course, from now on, it\\'ll protect you too. I know you don\\'t trust the ones behind it, but you\\'ll find a way to take advantage of its power, right?",
    "769": "You want me to work \\\\\"under\\\\\" you? I suppose I can do that. I can do whatever you want me to do, only at the cost of everything you have, or a flower that has freshly come out of its bud.",
    "770": "I have nothing to ask of you, except that... you must take better care of yourself. Keeping you safe is no easy task. But, if push comes to shove, I might have to make the best use of your life in the right time and right place.",
    "771": "Shh... I\\'m counting your heartbeats. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen... Mm, it\\'s fun. Your heart is full of fascinating emotions. How about you? Would you be able to understand the language of my heart?",
    "772": "I\\'ve worked for many, and many have worked for me. But you... you are truly different, one of a kind. You can achieve more, you can make a much bigger difference than me. So... stay here with me, don\\'t leave me, don\\'t walk away.",
    "773": "Tell me about the books you like, and music, movies, places, and the people you are fond of... Yes, I want to know more about you, learn more about your world. I want to have the image of you burned into my mind before your fate catches up with you, before you meet your solitary end.",
    "774": "*Humming",
    "775": "Okay, okay... This is a \\\\\"virgin\\\\\" territory for you, huh? Now, give me your hand. I\\'ll teach you how to do it properly. Try to remember the steps.",
    "776": "Do you have to stare at me like that? All right then, I\\'m gonna do the same to you.",
    "777": "Hmm, that\\'s new... Can you assign more people for me?",
    "778": "Don\\'t worry, it\\'s been a smooth trip. These good lambs have done a wonderful job.",
    "779": "Ah, this feels familiar...",
    "780": "Oh, you want a reward too?",
    "781": "Oh, I don\\'t have much to contribute on the front line. I\\'ll count on you guys.",
    "782": "Watch out.",
    "783": "You got it.",
    "784": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "785": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "786": "Hmm...",
    "787": "Yes?",
    "788": "Not satisfied with my performance? I should work harder in the future? Sure, if it\\'s what you want me to do.",
    "789": "Seems like you\\'re really not cut out for \\\\\"social events\\\\\" like this one. Don\\'t worry, I know you\\'ve tried your best. Leave the rest to me.",
    "790": "I\\'ll never forget what you\\'ve done for me.",
    "791": "Eastside nights all unfold like this one, I\\'m all too familiar with this scene. It\\'s like deja vu, isn\\'t it... Who\\'d want to get stuck in this limbo if they didn\\'t have their hidden agendas?",
    "792": "Can\\'t hold back your desires even at a time like this? My, aren\\'t you an adorable child.",
    "793": "Both flattery and curses are but the frivolous chatter of those who look up to you. Don\\'t let it get to your head. After all, you\\'re not one of them.",
    "794": "Most Eastsiders are immersed in a dream they\\'ll never wake up from. You and I are the only exceptions. The word \\\\\"dream\\\\\" has had nothing to do with us since a long time ago.",
    "795": "This soirée... these spotlights and flowers, celebrities and tycoons... and even myself... We\\'re all just the side dishes. You\\'re the only entrée of tonight.",
    "796": "Too many mistakes have happened in DisCity. Even I can\\'t deal with them all. But you... you\\'re different. You shoulder everyone\\'s hopes and dreams... Just go ahead and do what you have to do. Don\\'t worry about making mistakes. I\\'ll cover for you...",
    "797": "In the end, regardless by whom, I\\'m bound to be abandoned... I won\\'t blame you. After all, it\\'s your destiny.",
    "798": "You like being with me? Hehe... Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t leave.",
    "799": "Welcome to Fortuna! Oh, pardon me. That\\'s how I used to start conversations. Old habits die hard. But many do seem to have an acting talent here... Shall we have a chat about that soon?",
    "800": "Don\\'t just stare at me. Enjoy the show!",
    "801": "Come on, let\\'s have a drink to celebrate the perfect ending of the grand finale!",
    "802": "My dear, time for you to shine on stage!",
    "803": "The curtain fell on the perfect show! Such a fascinating story!",
    "804": "Sigh, a rare stage accident...",
    "805": "Please enjoy the show!",
    "806": "All dreams vanish at this moment...",
    "807": "Hmm, you came right when I thought of you. Well done! You deserve the praise.",
    "808": "If it\\'s what you wish, a word from me can promote you from an understudy to the main cast... But you must repay me for my investment.",
    "809": "Drop the formality with me... You don\\'t need your sanity here, my dear. Just enjoy yourself and make bold choices!",
    "810": "Let me teach you the way to survive in this theater... Give your love to all, but never all your love to one.",
    "811": "The theater is indeed an intricate thing. The seats in the boxes are red velvet. The chairs in the hall are the cheapest material. But just like how a play treats the audience equally, when the tickets are sold out, even the city councilors will have to rush to sit on the floor.",
    "812": "Imagine how boring it\\'ll be if we all follow the predetermined path! Everyone needs to let loose and go a little crazy at some point... No matter who you become and where you go in the future, that moment will be an irreplaceable memory.",
    "813": "A kiss is a wonderful but fleeting thing. When it fades, reality hits and the madness dries up. Some people accept it, others spiral. I wonder, if it were you, what unexpected choices would you make?",
    "814": "Every moment with you, the next step always seems unpredictable. You are my most cherished dancer, my most beautiful singer. I\\'d let the flames swallow the entire theater, and we\\'d be acting out the utmost frenzy until we turn to ashes.",
    "815": "I love watching those kids on stage, seeing them so eager to drop everything and choose a different life... Hmm, how I enjoy these moments.",
    "816": "It\\'s truly dazzling, but for me, it\\'s just some old tricks...",
    "817": "Do you prefer me over those pretty, adorable young ones? Hehe... You\\'re bold and untamed, and that\\'s what I like about you.",
    "818": "Sigh, how come I still need to go to social occasions personally...",
    "819": "What a spectacle! Here, I even brought you a little souvenir.",
    "820": "Oh my, flowers for me? Have you mistaken me for some big name on stage? But sure, I\\'ll accept them.",
    "821": "Don\\'t be naughty... Now is not the time for that...",
    "822": "If this scene could be reenacted, what would be your choice?",
    "823": "Careful, don\\'t get hurt...",
    "824": "Sure, whatever you say.",
    "825": "Oh my...",
    "826": "(Exclaims softly)",
    "827": "(Confused, slightly more serious)",
    "828": "Oh my...",
    "829": "Don\\'t just stare at me. Enjoy the show!",
    "830": "The time is ripe, so I\\'ve come to meet you. My dear... partner in crime.",
    "831": "Power is a shortcut to a goal, but... it\\'s not the only means.",
    "832": "I\\'ve already reached the summit. Does the view here... meet your expectations?",
    "833": "I wonder what surprises await me here.",
    "834": "Everything is as I\\'ve planned.",
    "835": "I\\'ve almost forgotten the taste of failure...",
    "836": "Vanish!",
    "837": "I can\\'t... go down like this...",
    "838": "Dramatic changes are coming our way. What will be your course of action today? I\\'m intrigued, Chief.",
    "839": "You can treat me as a prisoner, or you can treat me as a partner... Think about it. Money is not the only thing Quinn can offer you. There is much more beyond your imagination.",
    "840": "I like playing chess. On the chessboard, we focus only on each other, racking our brains to corner the other person. What pure pleasure.",
    "841": "I know you\\'re the straightforward type, but don\\'t wear your heart on your sleeve. Try to make your behavior more... unpredictable.",
    "842": "The DisCity is such a wonderful place. It\\'s the center of the world, the future of humanity... Is it willing to take me in?",
    "843": "Money and status, trust and friendship, even fear and threat... All of these are bargaining chips for loyalty, and I can sustain this trade indefinitely.",
    "844": "I\\'d hate to face you in battle, but... if that day really came, I\\'d expect nothing less than a satisfying fight from you.",
    "845": "You... are mine. My pawn, my collectible, with whom I share all my secrets. Never betray me... No one can betray me.",
    "846": "Play a game of chess with me... Don\\'t turn me down so quickly. I\\'ll give you a head start this time.",
    "847": "If there is something you desire, just tell me honestly. You and I, we don\\'t need to play this game.",
    "848": "Are you meeting me as a challenger, a negotiator, or... a close friend? Regardless of your answer, I\\'m glad.",
    "849": "Hmm... Alright, show me what you\\'ve been planning.",
    "850": "The deed is done. How are you going to pay me for my service? How about... paying with yourself?",
    "851": "You can never have too much power at your disposal.",
    "852": "How nostalgic. I was once treated so tenderly by some too, but... they\\'re all gone from this world now.",
    "853": "Getting my hands dirty could be fun.",
    "854": "Danger!",
    "855": "A sound decision.",
    "856": "(Grunts)",
    "857": "(Bellows)",
    "858": "Hmm?",
    "859": "Mmm!",
    "860": "Power is a shortcut to a goal, but... it\\'s not the only means.",
    "861": "Whether the tide ebbs and flows, one can see it all here—Chief, why don\\'t you take a seat and enjoy the view?",
    "862": "Vacations have always been the privilege of victors. Those who are powerless to control the circumstances cannot afford to relax.",
    "863": "You have come at just the right time. Now is the perfect time to challenge your destined nemesis.",
    "864": "Hmm? I don\\'t take provocations from opponents lightly. As punishment, I\\'m going to make you... count the waves with me.",
    "865": "Dark tides churn beneath the sea\\'s deceptively calm surface. Huge tidal waves could hit at any time... However, for me, \\\\\"danger\\\\\" is just an afterthought to business.",
    "866": "Each and every sunrise is unique, yet people arrogantly assume they are always looking at the same sun... Thanks to their stupidity, Quinn is where it is today.",
    "867": "A toast to the dawn we forged together. Cheers!",
    "868": "Do you like the neckline of this swimsuit? Don\\'t underestimate it. This silky fabric sheathes not just an alluring beauty, but a femme fatale who never misses a kill.",
    "869": "It\\'s rare to have a chance to be alone with you like this. I\\'m a bit tipsy. Want to do something other than play chess?",
    "870": "Are you watching the sunrise over the sea, or something else? No need to avert your gaze. I don\\'t mind.",
    "871": "Who are you? The look in your eyes... You weren\\'t sent by my \\\\\"dear\\\\\" big brothers or sisters, I presume? So... are you here to seek cooperation with me? All right then, make your pitch.",
    "872": "No one would complain about having too many trump cards up their sleeves. I\\'m no exception.",
    "873": "I hope you\\'ve spent your time away honing your skills. I don\\'t want a partner who can\\'t keep up with me intellectually.",
    "874": "I\\'m up against the legitimate children in the Campbell family. I have next to nothing going for me in comparison with them. Now, do you still want to be on my side? Hehe, that\\'s interesting. I\\'m starting to suspect that you have some ulterior motive.",
    "875": "My father doesn\\'t interfere in our rivalry. It\\'s a Campbell\\'s duty to prove their superiority. \\\\\"The winner takes it all.\\\\\" That\\'s the only rule of the game.",
    "876": "Are the people around here always this laid-back? Heh, the Campbells never put their feet up and relax at this age.",
    "877": "(Sneers) This is why you wanted to cooperate with me, isn\\'t it? That\\'s the oldest trick in the book.",
    "878": "All right, stay here with me for a while. I\\'ll break the plan down for you.",
    "879": "Seems like fate brought us together again, Chief. Long time no see.",
    "880": "Fear not the darkness of night, for there is the light of the stars.",
    "881": "The greatest meaning in my humble life is to face the endless darkness without fear.",
    "882": "Start",
    "883": "It\\'s all thanks to you. Great job.",
    "884": "Quick... tell everyone to retreat...",
    "885": "To the stars!",
    "886": "I\\'m sorry. I can\\'t go on with you anymore.",
    "887": "Chief, today\\'s work hasn\\'t been completed yet, has it? ...Just kidding, I\\'m no longer that intimidating adjutant.",
    "888": "Last time we chatted here, I was still your first-class adjutant, but now I am a prisoner in custody... Just kidding, I\\'m glad to stand by your side like everyone else.",
    "889": "I used to dream of working at an observatory, because nothing is more romantic than the starry skies. What, you don\\'t believe me?",
    "890": "I continued to observe you while we were apart. You have become stronger. Maybe you\\'d be better off without me? Just kidding, how could I abandon you...",
    "891": "Dove is already dead. We each made our own choices seven years ago... but Heitzper is my friend, and that will never change.",
    "892": "The Forgotten Stars are just a bunch of fanatics. They are controlled by fear, and likewise try to sow fear to indulge their inflated fantasies... They don\\'t even know what it is that they worship. They know nothing.",
    "893": "I know there is boundless darkness in you. If one day you become exhausted and consumed by the darkness, I will end your long-suffering pain with my own hands. Rest assured, even at that point, I won\\'t abandon you.",
    "894": "I\\'m sorry about what happened before, Chief... This may not count much as compensation, but I promise not to leave you again.",
    "895": "Chief? Looks like you are tired. Thank you for your hard work. Leave the rest to me...",
    "896": "Chief, you usually do this kind of thing when you forget that you still have work to do. Need I remind you?",
    "897": "If you need it, I\\'d be happy to help you with your work—just like old times.",
    "898": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "899": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "900": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "901": "Fear not the darkness of night, for there is the light of the stars.",
    "902": "I never hesitate to step towards a companion... Take me with you, my little monster.",
    "903": "How I wish to see what has become of my soul now.",
    "904": "Seeing me like this, what do you have on your mind now? I wish to hear it from you...",
    "905": "I\\'ve already seen through you. Save your futile struggle and surrender...",
    "906": "Upright Chariot. I knew the victory would be ours.",
    "907": "Well, accidents happen in battles... It can\\'t be helped...",
    "908": "I will read your mind and everything else... I will see through your soul!",
    "909": "At long last... my soul is freed...",
    "910": "According to the crystal, I\\'ll be the first person you\\'ll see today...",
    "911": "The white desert is like a pure dreamland where immaculate flowers bloom...",
    "912": "You seem to be really fond of my ability... Do you want to have your fortune read? Relax, whatever you want to know... <i>I have an answer for you...<\/i>",
    "913": "Never ask where they\\'re from. Never ask where they\\'ll go. Those are my rules of fortune-telling... Well, unless I answer those questions first...",
    "914": "The souls from the Black Ring possess true and pure beauty. They are not ugly at all. On the contrary, those <i>humans<\/i> who confine themselves... don\\'t you think they look more ridiculous?",
    "915": "I hear that you\\'re looking into my past? Why don\\'t you just ask me? Hmm... Which version do you want to hear?",
    "916": "I have visited the realm of truth in my dreams. I hope that... one day, you will appear there as well.",
    "917": "Now, I can take off all my disguises and show you my truest self... Hmm, what is it? All I did was lose a few pieces of clothing, are you shy?",
    "918": "Shh... I\\'m communicating with the souls.",
    "919": "Are you satisfied with physical touch alone? Why don\\'t you let me teach you... how to embrace each other\\'s soul?",
    "920": "You give me so much attention... Wanna run away with me, my dear little monster?",
    "921": "Hmm, is it the land of truth and purity before us?",
    "922": "I feel most at ease around you.",
    "923": "The true form of the soul is so elusive, yet so fascinating...",
    "924": "Ha, that\\'s exactly how those novice fortune-tellers touch the crystal ball.",
    "925": "Oh, those who are lost... Get in line if you want to have your fortune read...",
    "926": "Humph!",
    "927": "Aye... Since it\\'s coming from you...",
    "928": "Pffft!",
    "929": "Ha!",
    "930": "Huh?!",
    "931": "Tsk.",
    "932": "How I wish to see what has become of my soul now.",
    "933": "Finder of the legendary magic lamp of WhiteSands, you\\'ve summoned me. As a reward, I can grant you a wish.",
    "934": "These kitties quite enjoy your petting.",
    "935": "Poor lamb, have you lost your way in the desert? Fret not... Just follow me.",
    "936": "Those who share the water of life under WhiteSands\\' moon will meet again on the other side. Emm... You gaze... Do you want to raise a glass with me?",
    "937": "Charming her prey with her tame and lovely appearance. Luring them with their desires into her trap. Taking a fatal bite into the veins... Hmm? I\\'m only talking about... this adorable sand cat.",
    "938": "How many nights have passed already?",
    "939": "A heedless stroke at the cat\\'s tail may come with consequences...",
    "940": "As long as you stay by my side forever, I can grant you... any wish.",
    "941": "The mission has been judged as a success! Hero, time to celebrate. You can take me away now.",
    "942": "Aha, that\\'s more like it! This is what the \\\\\"Game Master\\\\\" deserves!",
    "943": "From now on, I shall dictate the rules of the game!",
    "944": "The game has begun! Come pick out a way to change your fate!",
    "945": "Congratulations on clearing the level! Heroes, go claim your bounty!",
    "946": "Ouch... It hurts... I knew that team would be hard to lead...",
    "947": "Obey my rules!",
    "948": "Everything has been... shattered...",
    "949": "The forces of darkness are about to descend upon the world... Hero, it\\'s time to embark on your journey!",
    "950": "Have no fear! Tell me what you want to do next.",
    "951": "Everything \\\\\"interesting\\\\\" in this world comes from \\\\\"imagination,\\\\\" so you don\\'t need to restrain yourself in front of me. Do you understand?",
    "952": "Not everyone can complete my games... But you look like someone with potential. Want to try it out?",
    "953": "\\\\\"Good,\\\\\" \\\\\"neutral,\\\\\" and \\\\\"evil\\\\\"... Which one do you think I am? Or rather, which one do you want me to be?",
    "954": "They all say that dragons are selfish and greedy, but I think... It\\'s just because no one dares to become close with them...",
    "955": "As long as you hold a dragon-slaying gun in your hand, it\\'s a symbol of justice, even if the gun is broken. So... what are you going to do to an evil dragon like me?",
    "956": "I\\'m addicted to dark and thrilling imagination, yet I fear the frosty loneliness there... Thank you for defeating me... Thank you, for being by my side.",
    "957": "Sometimes, the \\\\\"world\\\\\" wants to take a break, too... Let\\'s get some rest.",
    "958": "You acted without approval... This world will punish you.",
    "959": "Are the treasures you seek in my eyes?",
    "960": "Time for our spring trip!",
    "961": "I got a lot of items! Want to see what they are? As long as I\\'m here, nothing bad will happen.",
    "962": "It\\'s only fun when you have trade-offs for your base attributes.",
    "963": "You like my horn, too? Let me tell you about it! It was during a harsh, cold winter... Hey! Where are you going?",
    "964": "I\\'ll show you a good game.",
    "965": "Danger lies ahead. If you need to continue onwards, please roll the dice.",
    "966": "All right. I\\'ll try.",
    "967": "Urgh!",
    "968": "Hem.",
    "969": "Huh?",
    "970": "Pfft...",
    "971": "Aha, that\\'s more like it! This is what the \\\\\"Game Master\\\\\" deserves!",
    "972": "As night falls, ghostly lanterns flicker to life. The ancient castle of the dragon will reopen its dusty gates, beckoning the chosen warriors with its secrets and treasures... Hehe, how\\'s that? Immersive enough?",
    "973": "Gaze from the Devil takes effect, Luck +1!",
    "974": "The clock has struck midnight. No time to dawdle! Embark on a brand new adventure alongside the dark demon from the Land of Oblivion! Uh-huh, that means me, your guide!",
    "975": "These pumpkins are too cute? Umm, maybe they do look a little... Hold on! The game we\\'re playing today is horror themed! They are obviously appalling! How can they be cute!",
    "976": "Hmm? Candy? D-don\\'t think you can buy me off with a measly two pieces of candy! I\\'m a demon, and demons are meant to cause trouble! You know that, right?",
    "977": "Dear traveler, please don\\'t let your guard down. The rocky path is full of temptations and traps, and the red-winged demon will eventually reveal her dragon\\'s claws and teeth.",
    "978": "Ahh! Don\\'t pull my tail! Acting without permission is not allowed! Not even to your guide! ...What kind of punishment you\\'ll face, you ask? Hmph, take... a... guess?",
    "979": "What are you looking at me for? Hurry up! Huh? You\\'re not really scared, are you? Relax, if you\\'re in any danger, I\\'ll make an exception and provide you with a little extra help... but don\\'t tell anyone about this!",
    "980": "Hey, hey, hey, I\\'m just a humble writer. What have I done that could get me arrested? Or... did I expose your secret?",
    "981": "Thanks for coming. I\\'ll write an excellent story this time.",
    "982": "Hmm, this is a moment that will make history.",
    "983": "Hopefully I\\'ll find some interesting news material.",
    "984": "MBCC\\'s Sinners Achieve Overwhelming Victory! That\\'s a nice headline, isn\\'t it?",
    "985": "Cough... Just as tough as some interviewees I\\'ve dealt with in the past...",
    "986": "Nevermore!",
    "987": "Haha... Will my death... be remembered...?",
    "988": "Huh? I\\'m not pulling an all-nighter to write. I\\'m staying up so I can see you as soon as you come.",
    "989": "My ghostwriting fees are cheap. Tell me, what do you want me to write? Gossip? Celebrity scandals? Or perhaps... a love poem?",
    "990": "A wacko? You know, most of us poets are a bit wacky.",
    "991": "It\\'s just an article. Does it really matter whether it\\'s true or not? Anyway... another spill of ink won\\'t make a difference to Syndicate.",
    "992": "I know about every change here every day. Do you know what it\\'s falling into now? Take a guess?",
    "993": "I don\\'t write stories about missing dogs and cats. I want to write about... the MBCC\\'s chief being lovesick and not leave my tiny newspaper office!",
    "994": "Words have a natural power in them. Their every pulse becomes my resistance against this world.",
    "995": "I record everything in Syndicate with a quill. Obviously, when you came to me... Oh, excuse me. I wanted to describe it with a line of poetry, but I don\\'t quite have it. You\\'ll have my sincerity, at least.",
    "996": "What a boring day. It\\'s the best time to present a limerick to the world.",
    "997": "Is this some new way to make me write faster? In that case, I\\'m not taking that job from you!",
    "998": "It seems like you care a lot about me! Are you worried about your image in my story? Relax, it\\'s perfect.",
    "999": "I used to love covering news outdoors, until I got shot in the knee...",
    "1000": "I\\'m exhausted... But I\\'ve found some useful material. After all, something interesting is always happening somewhere in the world.",
    "1001": "Raven\\'s happy. I-I...I mean the bird.",
    "1002": "That\\'s not a scar... It\\'s my medal, my medal for becoming a wacko.",
    "1003": "Who put a glass and roses on my grave?",
    "1004": "Watch it.",
    "1005": "You sure know how to order me around.",
    "1006": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1007": "(Grunts)",
    "1008": "Yes?",
    "1009": "Whoa!",
    "1010": "Thanks for coming. I\\'ll write an excellent story this time.",
    "1011": "Oh my, are you the end of my thousand-year-long waiting, the observer who adores me? Want my autograph?",
    "1012": "Tell me, what secrets do you want to hear?",
    "1013": "Thirsty for the future of this world or the Paramartha of past history? Come, let me take you on a quest. Hmmm, where did the previous owner put that book...? Huh? The previous? Haha... Did I say \\\\\"previous owner\\\\\"? You must\\'ve heard me wrong... Haha.",
    "1014": "When in trouble, come to the library. It has the answers to all.",
    "1015": "Don\\'t be surprised if you see a crow reading here. It could be the previous owner returning to patrol her treasures.",
    "1016": "The rules dictate that I can only answer the questions that this library has answers to, and you can only ask 3 questions each turn, so query after careful thought.",
    "1017": "Hey hey hey, this is a dress made by the rules of the world! You... Tsk, Etti rented this dress for me. It\\'s very expensive. Be careful not to tear it!",
    "1018": "Are you curious about who I am? Do I look like someone you are very familiar with?",
    "1019": "Hello, wandering souls. Come and pick up this \\\\\"Call at 3 AM.\\\\\" Wandering around on a lightless night, are you trying to say something to me?",
    "1020": "The midnight chime sounded. Come, stay with me...",
    "1021": "I will turn everything you give me into a cage that binds you...!",
    "1022": "The phone is ringing, my dear. I\\'m right behind you...",
    "1023": "Goodbye, my dear.",
    "1024": "The phone keeps ringing non-stop... Gimme a break...",
    "1025": "Thank you for tuning in.",
    "1026": "No... No... Stop talking...",
    "1027": "What story will you share with me today?",
    "1028": "If you can\\'t sleep, why not tune in to my broadcast, \\\\\"Call at 3 AM\\\\\". I hope it can bring some gentleness into your night.",
    "1029": "People always look for something they desire, something that soothe them in me. How sad... Ah, but, I\\'m looking forward to you being a guest on my show.",
    "1030": "I can take all the emotions others flood me with, and grind them with my mind and heart into a smiling voice on the airwaves.",
    "1031": "Humans are such amazing creatures. After that electrifying moment of locking eyes, you and I no longer look the same for each other.",
    "1032": "If it weren\\'t for all those rumors and legends, I could read poems or tell a story to the sound of the midnight rain... then greet the first ray of dawn after a rainy night...",
    "1033": "\\\\\"Her silhouette slowly approaches you from behind, envelops you, and finally... embraces you...!\\\\\" Oops, did I startle you? Don\\'t be scared... it\\'s just me.",
    "1034": "My views have been overturned, and my world has been changed, but I know... this is not misfortune. Thank you for becoming the fissure in this world to free me from my shackles...",
    "1035": "A Little Poem, line 27: \\\\\"If the world could be changed by dreaming, then I would sleep in this dream and never wake up, until the joyous world of my imagination has been created.\\\\\"",
    "1036": "You want me to stay with you this much...? Don\\'t worry... I\\'ll call you tonight.",
    "1037": "Don\\'t be so nervous. I can stay on the line with you. You just continue with what you\\'re doing, and I\\'ll be here with you. If you still feel ill at ease... how about I sing a song for you?",
    "1038": "Let me see, what\\'s different about your world.",
    "1039": "This is all that I can give you.",
    "1040": "Come, come closer... a little bit more.",
    "1041": "Do you want to know how much I\\'ve missed you?",
    "1042": "The phone is ringing, my dear.",
    "1043": "Get out of here, quick!",
    "1044": "All right, I will follow your orders.",
    "1045": "Ha~",
    "1046": "Ha!",
    "1047": "Yes?",
    "1048": "Ah!",
    "1049": "The midnight chime sounded. Come, stay with me...",
    "1050": "You\\'ve woken me from reverie. I should thank you, but... where else does a dancer without a stage belong?",
    "1051": "It is my destiny to comfort more souls with this power. I won\\'t run away from it anymore.",
    "1052": "This is not yet the end. Until my life burns out, my dance will go on.",
    "1053": "The battered soul is singing, leading the way for us.",
    "1054": "The revelry is over. Rest in peace, I will take you home.",
    "1055": "The music ends, the dance stops, the crowd vanishes...",
    "1056": "Let the dance begin!",
    "1057": "Don\\'t drop the curtain yet...",
    "1058": "Whenever I\\'m lost in reverie, you\\'ll show up and pull me back to reality... Hello, Chief. Welcome back.",
    "1059": "With the purest admiration for art in the audience, and the utter beauty in the world to interpret, I do not feel lonely.",
    "1060": "Insatiable desire, a siege by Corruptors, and a dark prison cell, which one is real imprisonment?",
    "1061": "The body can speak for me, expressing gratitude, joy, struggle, and pain... Unfortunately, not everyone can understand it.",
    "1062": "Ugly monsters? Please don\\'t speak of them like that. Those beings known as Corruptors are my most loyal audience.",
    "1063": "The center of a Black Ring is like the depths of the sea. In a place so serene, you can listen to your heart clearly.",
    "1064": "A brutal beast will not know how to love, so... please never turn into one.",
    "1065": "Certain emotions can only be expressed through dance. Come, give me your hand, follow my tempo... Can you... feel it, Chief?",
    "1066": "Shh... Listen, that\\'s the sound of your heart. Lub dub, lub dub... It\\'s dancing too.",
    "1067": "Are you... lonely? It\\'s okay. I don\\'t like to be touched by others, but you\\'re the exception.",
    "1068": "Such clear eyes... It must be wonderful to dance to the gaze from such a pair of eyes.",
    "1069": "The sound of the wind... is a dance gifted to us by nature.",
    "1070": "I\\'m back. It was... a good experience.",
    "1071": "I feel... light as a feather?",
    "1072": "Hmm? Would you like to... dance with me?",
    "1073": "I can hear it... the prelude of the dance...",
    "1074": "Be careful.",
    "1075": "I understand...",
    "1076": "(Grunts)",
    "1077": "(Bellows)",
    "1078": "Eh?",
    "1079": "Ahhh!",
    "1080": "It is my destiny to comfort more souls with this power. I won\\'t run away from it anymore.",
    "1081": "Swaying bells and heavy drumbeats... Come, let\\'s dance. Let\\'s dance on this snowy night!",
    "1082": "The tempo... has quickened.",
    "1083": "Every day without dance is a letdown to life. So... Come and dance with me, will you, Chief?",
    "1084": "Hmm...? This is an updo I specifically did for this dance. Do you... like it?",
    "1085": "The steps, the emotions, the body, the mind... Each element is essential. It\\'s not merely a dance, but also a hymn to the soul.",
    "1086": "The strong emotions in this dance complement the atmosphere of the festival perfectly... Can everyone feel it?",
    "1087": "It\\'s been a long time since I last saw such pure smiles after a performance. It truly feels wonderful...",
    "1088": "How I wish time could stop at this moment tonight forever... Hmm... I\\'m indeed very greedy.",
    "1089": "I was touched by the power and generosity in this dance during the practices. May all your pain and unhappiness be gone after watching this dance.",
    "1090": "Now that you\\'re looking at me, please don\\'t turn your gaze away. I will deliver my emotions to you through my dance.",
    "1091": "Painful but elegant, each feather has its own story. This is a dance dedicated to you and you alone...",
    "1092": "Let\\'s spread our wings to our heart\\'s content.",
    "1093": "Chief, this dance is very difficult. Those without proper training should not try the jumps and twirls.",
    "1094": "You still want to try it...? Hmm, the final scene where I get lifted up... I think you can manage it.",
    "1095": "Black and white, light and darkness... are but two sides of the same coin. Just like Odette and Odile, whom I portray. In the prince\\'s eyes, they\\'ve always been the same person.",
    "1096": "The scattered black feathers push the entire performance to its climax. Beauty and destruction are only a step away. This is the fate of beauty.",
    "1097": "Chief, who do you think I resemble more now? The innocent Swan Princess Odette, or the unbridled Black Swan Odile?",
    "1098": "Back then, people didn\\'t want to see me portray Odile. They wanted to see absolute joy and beauty from me. I was more like the perfect white swan in their hearts, rather than a dancer...",
    "1099": "Everyone knows that the soul and biggest challenge of this dance is Odile\\'s thirty-two consecutive fouettés. Yet under your gaze, I completed it effortlessly...",
    "1100": "How I wish we could be enveloped by music and dance, and savor this moment in bliss and freedom, forever.",
    "1101": "Keep going ahead and you\\'ll see the Gate of Hell. Are you here to welcome me, or to bid farewell to me?",
    "1102": "A good piece of work needs to be polished and refined carefully.",
    "1103": "The present me is finally able to breathe life into them...",
    "1104": "There, there. It\\'s normal to get scared...",
    "1105": "The contorted faces and terrified screams are truly irresistible.",
    "1106": "We\\'ll start again from scratch.",
    "1107": "Face your fear head-on!",
    "1108": "Oh... Such a warm embrace...",
    "1109": "Hello, Chief. Did you have fun last night?",
    "1110": "I\\'ve always been devoted to nature, but this world is no different than hell to me.",
    "1111": "Artist? Do I deserve this title in your opinion?",
    "1112": "Only when you\\'re most frightened will you follow your most primal instincts... That\\'s the true colors of humans.",
    "1113": "Sculpture is not a superficial art. It\\'s a form of creation that touches bones and flesh and forms the shape of life.",
    "1114": "My chisel and hammer will surely carve through those hypocritical illusions and subvert everything!",
    "1115": "If I could... I wish to frame your terrified face just for myself to admire... Haha, don\\'t be scared, it\\'s only an idea.",
    "1116": "If you call me the witch of the night, then don\\'t blame me for peeking into your heart. I wish to see life that erupts from the inside out. It will germinate, grow, and bloom into a flower named love...",
    "1117": "Since I\\'m free... Why don\\'t I carve a few flowers on these ugly iron bars?",
    "1118": "Alright, I\\'ve memorized it. I\\'ll carve holes on you later according to the order of your touches just now.",
    "1119": "Okay, okay. You\\'re already eye-catching enough... What? You won\\'t believe me unless I actually take out my eyeballs and give them to you?",
    "1120": "Go out to find inspiration? Can I come back before the evening?",
    "1121": "I\\'ve found my inspiration. Now, let the Witching Hour begin.",
    "1122": "Hmm! It\\'s carved perfectly.",
    "1123": "What? Do you want to nurture some artsy vibe as well?",
    "1124": "Do you want a brand from me?",
    "1125": "Watch out.",
    "1126": "No need to say.",
    "1127": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1128": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1129": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1130": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1131": "A good piece of work needs to be polished and refined carefully.",
    "1132": "Welcome to the sculptor\\'s nest, my most secret garden. Herein lies fears and struggles, distortions and pain... as well as boundless love.",
    "1133": "With a flash of lightning and a speeding heart, Venus is born from my hands.",
    "1134": "As soon as I prayed to the sculpture to meet you, you appeared before my eyes. Do I have a unique power of making wishes come true?",
    "1135": "Did the artist make the hat special, or did the hat become the symbol of the artist?",
    "1136": "It\\'s the greatest joy to carve out the imagination with my own hands.",
    "1137": "Fix your gaze on the sculptures. If you can\\'t look fear in the eye, you might get crushed by it...",
    "1138": "For convenience\\'s sake, I added many practical little pockets on my clothes to hold carving tools.",
    "1139": "Why is this work unfinished? Hehe... Maybe \\\\\"she\\\\\" needs someone who loves \\\\\"her\\\\\" to make up for the missing half of her heart...",
    "1140": "Thump, thump, thump... You hear that? I\\'m sculpting heartbeats.",
    "1141": "I can\\'t work properly if you keep staring at me like this... Hmm? Do you want to model for me or something?",
    "1142": "I\\'m so glad that you\\'ve brought me to this grand feast. Ah... I can smell an intoxicating sweet aroma in every corner!",
    "1143": "That\\'s not enough to satisfy me...",
    "1144": "If it\\'s for the pursuit of the ultimate savor, I am willing to be dined on.",
    "1145": "Hmm... Let me savor it.",
    "1146": "It makes a decent meal.",
    "1147": "...Inedible.",
    "1148": "I smell the sweet fragrance of souls!",
    "1149": "Ha... Hahaha... Tear it up, gobble it down...",
    "1150": "The green fairy flew by. First, I see reality, then fear, and at last... I see you.",
    "1151": "Eating is not simply an act of \\\\\"swallowing\\\\\". Once you learn how to \\\\\"savor\\\\\" a dish, it\\'ll turn into a wonderful experience. So, face your desire for food honestly and satisfy it the best you can!",
    "1152": "I\\'ve acquired many extremely rare ingredients before. Some of them cost as much as a house, but still... none could compare to those sweet grapes I\\'ve once had.",
    "1153": "When you were born into a high position, everything you see is covered in a blurry haze. But if you search hard enough, you may just find those souls who glitter brilliantly.",
    "1154": "I\\'ve always had an overly obsessive and passionate preference for things that can satisfy my taste, and it so happens that my status can sate my willful obsession.",
    "1155": "Honorable humans give off a fascinating, irresistible aroma... They\\'re like great black grapes that ferment into ruby-hued wine, so tempting for my palate.",
    "1156": "Warm juice exploding on the tip of the tongue, caressing the mouth, sliding down the throat into the stomach... This is how you make me feel. I\\'m sorry... It looks like simply staying by your side no longer satisfies me. I wish... we could truly become one.",
    "1157": "Your soul is a mix of dreams and reality, art and life. Before it matures, I\\'m willing to bear the searing hunger and tame the urge to kiss your lip. Until this plump, mouth-watering fruit blooms before my eyes and offers itself to me...",
    "1158": "Sigh... I haven\\'t got much of an appetite.",
    "1159": "The cunning visitor from the abyss has been waiting to prey on those... dishonest beings.",
    "1160": "You seem to be looking forward to dining with me too, don\\'t you?",
    "1161": "Do I need to... do it myself?",
    "1162": "A novel experience.",
    "1163": "Hmm, it tastes good.",
    "1164": "For some ingredients, this part, indeed, is the most flavorful. Do you think so?",
    "1165": "Thank you for your warm invitation.",
    "1166": "Careful.",
    "1167": "Hehe...",
    "1168": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1169": "Hey.",
    "1170": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1171": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1172": "That\\'s not enough to satisfy me...",
    "1173": "Welcome to the paradise of bliss and abundance. Only here can your unique and rich soul be nourished... Come, won\\'t you share a drink with me?",
    "1174": "Fruity and full-bodied... Truly a fine wine.",
    "1175": "Earth-sprung honey, horn-poured raindrop, and Limnio kissed by thunder, blended into this cup\\'s swirling ambrosial nectar... Drink, and share with me this unparalleled pleasure.",
    "1176": "Hehe, don\\'t worry, I\\'m still sober. One must know their limits to enjoy this light-headed rapture...",
    "1177": "Why hesitate? If you are still tethered by worldly troubles, why not take some of this adorable fruit? It will make you forget all your sorrows and burdens... You will certainly love it.",
    "1178": "No one can resist pleasure. Slowly, they will be marinated in joy and mature in indulgence... until every blood vessel is flowing with the fruity fragrance. A different kind of decadent and luxurious taste...",
    "1179": "Do you also think it\\'s lacking something? Indeed, the finest drink demands the most exquisite ingredient for the pinnacle of sensory delight. Like a soul as sharp and unwavering as yours...",
    "1180": "Compared to humans, animals have much simpler desires. This adorable one here knows exactly what it wants and longs for nothing more. Human desires, however, are complex and insatiable... Is this evolution or degeneration?",
    "1181": "Relax, there is no rush. Neither hunger nor thirst exist here. You may take your time to savor every detail before making your decision. Unlike the harsh mortal world... everything here is forgiving, especially to you.",
    "1182": "Are you waiting for me to do it? I see... My warmth and breath are your perfect accompaniment for this wine and fruit.",
    "1183": "Feel honored I\\'m willing to walk into this place. I\\'d like to have a little garden outside my room. Thanks.",
    "1184": "I recognize your hard work, my child.",
    "1185": "Enjoy being surrounded by flowers.",
    "1186": "Who will bloom under my sword today?",
    "1187": "The splash of petals is incomparably gorgeous.",
    "1188": "I\\'ll spare your life for now...",
    "1189": "Bloom here, till the day you wither!",
    "1190": "This will be... the grandest flower shower...",
    "1191": "I hope we\\'re both free from work today, so we can stay here... and rest a whole day...",
    "1192": "I cherish and care for every flower in the Garden. I hope my nurture will give them leaves sharp enough to cut through hardships, so their souls can bloom into the most beautiful flowers...",
    "1193": "Rules can\\'t confine the wish to bloom. A sprout born in the dark will eventually break them into pieces.",
    "1194": "Working for pay is only the most basic way of life. The client gains convenience while I gain happiness. I enjoy my life much better than those who hustle for unrealistic, empty goals.",
    "1195": "Those who like flowers pick them. Those who love flowers water them... But I won\\'t mind if you pick me and take me home.",
    "1196": "Don\\'t give me those contrived moral lessons. In this world, nothing means more than the most simple words \\\\\"I want to.\\\\\"",
    "1197": "A kind and lovely lady like me will wash the dirt off those stems and nurture them properly, so they can be reborn as exquisite flowers in their next lives... Oh, how admirable am I!",
    "1198": "Flowers in bloom wither in the end. When the day comes, I long to rest in the immortal, deep-blue abyss of yours... May the poppies bloom on your chest like a scarlet blaze... The mark of my genuine affection...",
    "1199": "Touched by no one. Loved by no one. Though tortured by loneliness, it\\'ll bloom even more brightly.",
    "1200": "Don\\'t think you can get away with anything just because of my affection for you. Or else... You\\'ll be the next to lie in the soil of my garden.",
    "1201": "Sigh... I know, I\\'m pretty, that\\'s why you can\\'t keep your eyes off me.",
    "1202": "I can\\'t pick up my jacket. Can you put it on me, please?",
    "1203": "Ask someone else to do it next time. It\\'s so not for me.",
    "1204": "Look at me. Am I not good enough for you?",
    "1205": "Like this flower? Or... You wanna see how it got tinted red?",
    "1206": "Flowers will bloom wherever I go.",
    "1207": "Pay more attention.",
    "1208": "Are you giving orders to me?",
    "1209": "(Grunts)",
    "1210": "Ha!",
    "1211": "Hmm? (A little angry)",
    "1212": "Oh?",
    "1213": "I recognize your hard work, my child.",
    "1214": "Is this the Minos Bureau of Crisis Control? This time, will the burden named \\\\\"Eve\\\\\" be introduced to a different story?",
    "1215": "No miracles will happen to me anymore, right?",
    "1216": "If even a broken body can push beyond its limits, what about a shredded photo? Why can\\'t it be mended then...",
    "1217": "Why bring me along? I\\'ll only be a burden to everyone.",
    "1218": "Their misfortune has finally ended.",
    "1219": "Hello again... Cruel \\\\\"reality\\\\\".",
    "1220": "Go...",
    "1221": "Finally... We\\'re reunited...",
    "1222": "You\\'re here too... Don\\'t mind me, I\\'m just looking for a peaceful place to stay.",

    "1224": "Do you like the chimes of the clock after midnight? I love them. Once it rings, one can pretend dream and reality are the same thing.",
    "1225": "I used to think toys would always be by the owner\\'s side. But plastic weathers, porcelain breaks, metal rusts, and people grow up... Turns out \\\\\"change\\\\\" is the only constant.",
    "1226": "I once held the sweetest candy in the world, but it\\'s been too long, now it tastes more bitter than medicine. Thank you for reminding me of that sweetness, even just a little.",
    "1227": "Can I get a share of your smile and hope? I might have started yearning for the world in your eyes... So bright, so warm...",
    "1228": "If there really exists a night that never dawns, will you be there with me? In the endless night, we can count the stars together... and dream a never-ending dream.",
    "1229": "The fairy tale says \\\\\"your beloved one is always by your side, you just can\\'t see her\\\\\"... I reckon the fairy tale is lying again, because this time I see you.",

    "1231": "If such contact can satisfy your curiosity, do as you please. Don\\'t pity me, of all the things I\\'ve lost, my legs are the least important.",
    "1232": "Thanks for hanging out with me. If you don\\'t mind, could you push me outside for a bit? The fresh air helps take my mind off things for a while",
    "1233": "There are only limited places a wheelchair can reach. I suggest you do not expect too much from me.",
    "1234": "I\\'m back. If I\\'m not needed for anything else, please let me rest alone for a while.",
    "1235": "Why won\\'t you give up on this useless body...",
    "1236": "Your hand, can it stay a bit longer? I fear this warmth will be fleeting, just like before...",
    "1237": "It\\'s time for the toys to meet new friends.",
    "1238": "Don\\'t do silly things.",

    "1241": "A sound of efforts",
    "1242": "Hmph.",
    "1243": "Yes?",
    "1244": "No miracles will happen to me anymore, right?",
    "1245": "Good to see you\\'re well, Chief. Is bumping into you here a matter of destiny, coincidence... or a manipulated incident?",
    "1246": "How do you want me to repay you for helping me like this?",
    "1247": "The bell tolls, playing the rites of the people, praising the voices of humanity... The so-called \\\\\"sacred sign\\\\\" has always existed between you and me.",
    "1248": "Just at the right time.",
    "1249": "Thanks~",

    "1252": "Is this written in my fate... huh, how I hate it...",
    "1253": "Got some good news, Chief. Want to hear it? I drew a fortune for you. You\\'ll meet a very kind benefactor today... What are you looking for? Isn\\'t it obvious that I\\'m right in front of you?",
    "1254": "Gods can\\'t help you with your workload or relieve your stress, but maybe I can. Why don\\'t you give it a try by asking nicely?",
    "1255": "Some people long for those bizarre and magical stories, and some fear those miracles beyond human power... So, which one are you, Chief?",
    "1256": "A good fragrance, a collection of thoughts, a heart that seeks the truth—that\\'s all a mythologist needs.",
    "1257": "If there really are gods and ghosts in the world, why hasn\\'t anyone ever answer those pious wishes? But if they never existed... then where do people\\'s prayers go...",
    "1258": "Did you see it? The sun rises and sets... the ordinary daily life that is yearned for by some is right here...",
    "1259": "I\\'ve told you so many legends now, it\\'s only fair that I also hear some from you. But I don\\'t like to share. I want stories you\\'ve never told anyone before, some secrets only known to the heavens, earth, you, and me.",
    "1260": "You\\'ve given me truth, trust, strength, and a place to belong. I\\'ve really taken advantage of you. From now on, let me take my time to pay you back.",
    "1261": "Did you know, the Sun Crow can actually swim... Shh! This is a highly confidential heavenly secret. Don\\'t let anyone hear it.",
    "1262": "Stop messing around... My incense burner might just come alive and swallow you whole!",
    "1263": "Legend has it that if you bow three times and kowtow nine times towards the direction of the sunset, a wish can be granted... Oh, you didn\\'t fall for it?",
    "1264": "Such a bustling and glamorous foreign land. Aren\\'t you afraid I might be tempted away by this dazzling world?",
    "1265": "I\\'m back empty handed... Just kidding, here you go~",
    "1266": "So this is the craftsmanship of the great DisCity?",
    "1267": "In my hometown, casually touching other people\\'s heads could lead to... Nevermind, it\\'s better if you don\\'t know.",
    "1268": "Hmm... I must take this seriously now.",
    "1269": "Be careful.",
    "1270": "No problem.",
    "1271": "Ha.",
    "1272": "Ha~",

    "1277": "Oh? Is Sitri\\'s clarity enhanced?",
    "1278": "From now on, no one can hurt us. No one.",
    "1279": "Time for a vacation?",
    "1280": "That\\'s it?",
    "1281": "Oh... This feels worse than being rejected...",
    "1282": "Sitri, hold them off!",
    "1283": "How has it... come to this?",
    "1284": "Yo, you\\'re back. It\\'s been a while since I last saw you. I was a little concerned.",
    "1285": "Why do people always find me arrogant? I\\'m only honest about being rich.",
    "1286": "Look at the fire in this emerald. Isn\\'t it gorgeous? In fact, unrefined, its clarity was just so-so, but good faceting techniques work magic.",
    "1287": "The kids here are all adorable, but why won\\'t any of them take my money?",
    "1288": "I wonder how my kitties are doing at home... Can I bring them here, Chief? There aren\\'t that many of them, just... a little over a hundred.",
    "1289": "I believe I exist in this world for the gems... But am I truly as dazzling as they are?",
    "1290": "What would you say if I want to be your sugar mama, Chief? I\\'m serious.",
    "1291": "This is an inheritance distribution agreement. Come sign your name on it... If something happens to me one day, take care of the kids... and Sitri, with this money. Got it?",
    "1292": "Sitri, sweetheart, you know what to do when they come, don\\'t you?",
    "1293": "That reminds me, I\\'ve never paid to have somebody\\'s limbs cut off. I\\'d like to try it sometime.",
    "1294": "You\\'ve come to meet me specifically? Are you short on cash these days, Chief?",
    "1295": "A piece of cake.",
    "1296": "I\\'m back. Look, I\\'ve brought everyone souvenirs.",
    "1297": "Not bad.",
    "1298": "Oh, aren\\'t you going to tickle my chin too? Who knows, I might purr a little for you.",
    "1299": "Let\\'s go, Sitri.",
    "1300": "Danger!",
    "1301": "No problem",
    "1302": "(Grunts)",
    "1303": "(Bellows)",
    "1304": "Hmm?",
    "1305": "Ahhh!",
    "1306": "Oh? Is Sitri\\'s clarity enhanced?",
    "1307": "Welcome to my estate! Chief... You\\'re my rare and precious guest, just make yourself at home. It\\'ll be so boring if you\\'re too nervous.",
    "1308": "The night is long. Wanna do something fun?",
    "1309": "Let\\'s have a drink? Relax, Chief... It\\'s only pomegranate juice.",
    "1310": "Come closer, let me hear your breaths closely... Oh... you sound just like a kitten.",
    "1311": "Legend has it that if you keep chanting \\\\\"Countess Chelsea, take me as your sugar baby\\\\\" at a mirror in this room, no matter where I am, I\\'ll immediately appear. Don\\'t you want to try it?",
    "1312": "Sitri, you\\'re not eating your meals properly again today... Are the diamonds not to your taste? Sigh... Got it, I\\'ll fetch you a few of your favorite boulder opals now.",
    "1313": "You\\'re finally getting bolder, Chief. Can I treat this as a love confession from you?",
    "1314": "Time to close the curtains and enjoy this night with just the two of us.",
    "1315": "Did you lose this Golden Axe, or this Gemstone Axe? Don\\'t be shy! You can take both if you like!",
    "1316": "Ah... Just as I thought, when the water becomes clear, one\\'s mood is also lifted.",
    "1317": "Haha... You don\\'t need to pretend that you dropped something into the lake. I can give you anything you want, but on one teensy little condition... that is, to stay with me forever~",
    "1318": "This flower crown is a precious gift from the spirits under the lake. What do you think? Much prettier than those accessories priced with a string of zeros, right?",
    "1319": "For those who don\\'t suit my taste, even if every word they say is true, they are not worthy to take my collection.",
    "1320": "Every day, there are things that are forgotten, discarded, or lost. They slip right into the lake and come to me. So, what kind of things slipped through your fingers?",
    "1321": "Your palm is dry and warm... I love this feeling! Name your price. How many gems it takes for you to hold my hand like this forever?",
    "1322": "The water in the lake is my limbs, my heart, my dress... When you stir it, you are also touching me... Hehe, what, you don\\'t believe me? I can really merge with the water~",
    "1323": "Sitri, you went playing treasure hunt at the bottom of the lake again? You\\'ve dug up all these centuries-old things... Come here, let me wipe your paws.",
    "1324": "If you\\'re interested in me, just say it. I can take you to my home right now. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ve already prepared your room at the bottom of the lake. I specially decorated it with pearl curtains and a bed made of gems. You\\'ll definitely love it.",
    "1325": "Cinnabar, former supervisor of the private military company Serpent Eye. Anything concerning security, I should be of help.",
    "1326": "So this is how you hone your abilities... Sinners sure are special.",
    "1327": "No more <i>necessary sacrifices<\/i>. This power will protect everyone.",
    "1328": "Stay behind me.",
    "1329": "Rest assured, we\\'re safe now.",
    "1330": "I\\'ll hold them off, you get out of here now. Run!",
    "1331": "I\\'ll protect them!",
    "1332": "No... Not yet, not when they\\'re still here...",
    "1333": "Welcome back, Chief. There have been no irregular activities in the Bureau while you were away.",
    "1334": "As of now, I have a 100% assignment completion rate. You may rest assured that I will keep you safe.",
    "1335": "My seniors at Serpent Eye are the best teachers I\\'ve ever had. The things they\\'ve taught me are way more useful than the <i>professional knowledge<\/i> taught in the police academy.",
    "1336": "This is a GH-2 Shield Generator, custom-made high-end stuff from the Research Institute, very reliable. One thing though, it\\'s got a ton of parts inside, hence a real pain to repair.",
    "1337": "I was once lost too, about what I should protect, and how to do it. But after that incident, I\\'ve found my answer.",
    "1338": "In the past, besides protecting the big shots of Paradeisos, I often did safety assessment for large organizations. As for MBCC... things are more complicated. My previous experience is not quite applicable here.",
    "1339": "I\\'ve never protected anyone over such a long period. It\\'s like I\\'m your personal bodyguard. But well... I do like this job.",
    "1340": "Ever since leaving Serpent Eye, I haven\\'t met any comrades I can count on in a long time... It is my honor to fight beside you.",
    "1341": "Hmm... Where did I put my bulletproof plate?",
    "1342": "Please keep an appropriate distance... I can\\'t perform my tasks properly if you do that.",
    "1343": "Do you need close protection? Understood.",
    "1344": "No problem. I\\'ll get it done in no time.",
    "1345": "Mission accomplished. Hit me up whenever you need me.",
    "1346": "Security leveled up.",
    "1347": "Your command, please.",
    "1348": "Danger!",
    "1349": "I understand.",
    "1350": "(Grunts)",
    "1351": "(Bellows)",
    "1352": "Hmm?",
    "1353": "Hmm?!",
    "1354": "So this is how you hone your abilities... Sinners sure are special.",
    "1355": "It\\'s an honor to take part in this escort mission to the Rust. I\\'ve been looking forward to spending more time with you... Sorry... I... I just wanted you to know how happy I am.",
    "1356": "Guard power increased.",
    "1357": "There you are, Chief. Everything is ready. We can go now.",
    "1358": "Please tell me if you\\'re tired. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll clear a safe resting area for you.",
    "1359": "Be careful! Rockfalls and landslides are common around the Rust. Please stay close to me.",
    "1360": "Get some rest, Chief. No matter how long you need, I\\'ll be by your side.",
    "1361": "You seem out of breath. Did you notice anything unusual?",
    "1362": "The Rust is indeed dangerous. But don\\'t worry, I won\\'t let any harm come to you—it\\'s my duty.",
    "1363": "Traveling by horse might seem a bit... too much, but it\\'s a gesture from Miss Faye. She insisted we uphold the prestige of the MBCC... I can\\'t just disregard her kind intentions.",
    "1364": "I\\'ve been honing my horsemanship. It won\\'t be a bumpy ride, I promise.",
    "1365": "It\\'s time, Chief. I\\'m here to escort you to the party. Tonight, I\\'m the knight only for you.",
    "1366": "Would you like to pet him? It\\'s okay, he\\'s a gentle boy. Here, try riding him. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll protect you.",
    "1367": "This look sacrifices a bit of functionality for aesthetics and does look a bit constricted and cumbersome... But rest assured, I will make sure you are unscathed no matter what happens.",
    "1368": "Shh, easy there... Are you feeling thirsty?",
    "1369": "Ahem... Please don\\'t mess up these decorations. It\\'s a little time-consuming to wear them. After the party is over, I will take them off and give them to you, you can examine them however you want.",
    "1370": "This outfit suits me? Thanks... I\\'m glad to know you like it.",
    "1371": "I can sleep here all the time, right? Wow! It\\'s got so much space inside. Not even a breath of wind can get in! It\\'s much better than camping. Great, I finally have a place to stay!",
    "1372": "Thank you! This will allow me to finish the map quicker!",
    "1373": "One day, I will place beacons in every corner of WhiteSands. I\\'m confident of it now!",
    "1374": "Don\\'t worry. Fieldwork is my strong suit.",
    "1375": "Great! Now a safety beacon can be placed here too!",
    "1376": "Hurry! This way! We can duck through.",
    "1377": "Hide beside it!",
    "1378": "I don\\'t... feel well...",
    "1379": "Hello! I thought you got lost and was about to look for you.",
    "1380": "If you encounter a sandstorm, look for a beacon nearby... like this one in my hand. Hide next to it, then you should be able to survive it.",
    "1381": "Why do you keep catching those... they are called desert bandits, right? They hardly ever hit me with a gun. Sometimes they would ask me to be their guide and give me fresh water after getting them to places. I think they are nice people.",
    "1382": "Hehehe, I\\'m not as impressive as you said, at least not as good as Dad and Grandpa. I learned all my geography knowledge from the book grandpa wrote.",
    "1383": "Your food here is so delicious. Especially the broth—I would never have thought putting large chunks of meat and water together would taste so much better than roasting scorpions and lizards!",
    "1384": "There are a few very strange places in WhiteSands with people looking stern and carrying guns everywhere. I get kicked out every time I go in for a break—but it\\'s so spacious inside. How mean.",
    "1385": "I always thought if I placed beacons all over WhiteSands, my dad would come back. But it\\'s been seven years... I will finish his and Grandpa\\'s plan, then I will go find him.",
    "1386": "The starry sky over WhiteSands is incredibly stunning, especially when there\\'s a meteor shower... Let\\'s go see it together when we have the chance. There\\'s an awesome viewing spot that only I\\'d know.",
    "1387": "When Johnny Comes Marching Home",
    "1388": "Do you want my hat? But this one is very worn-out. Let me make a new one for you.",
    "1389": "You want me to stay here with you? Sure! By the way, when are we going back to WhiteSands? I have a lot of work to do there.",
    "1390": "Oh, did someone get lost?",
    "1391": "No need to pay me. I don\\'t need it. I\\'m glad I can help.",
    "1392": "Wind and sand can\\'t stop me!",
    "1393": "Okay, I\\'ll be the guide.",
    "1394": "Danger!",
    "1395": "Okay.",
    "1396": "(Grunts)",
    "1397": "(Bellows)",
    "1398": "Hmm?",
    "1399": "Ah!!",
    "1400": "Thank you! This will allow me to finish the map quicker!",
    "1401": "What are you doing? I\\'m a serious businessman. If you keep this up, I\\'m calling my lawyer! Help! Help! Assault! ...Of course I know lawyers can\\'t come here. You really have no sense of humor...",
    "1402": "There\\'s nothing fun about becoming strong in and of itself, but after becoming strong, you will have more ways to seek out fun.",
    "1403": "You give me things all day without taking any of my money... What\\'s in it for you? Could it be that you want <i>me<\/i>? You gotta be careful then, because I will ultimately leave after I\\'ve had my fun...",
    "1404": "Hey, want to know what you can buy from me... with your life?",
    "1405": "Woohoo! I made a killing this time!",
    "1406": "I lost a fortune! I\\'m not coming back.",
    "1407": "Everything of yours is mine now!",
    "1408": "Fair enough……",
    "1409": "Hey, when can I go out? If I don\\'t find some clients soon, my factory is going to go bankrupt... Alternatively, you can place some orders with me.",
    "1410": "You gotta make friends to succeed in business, and to make friends, you gotta have fun with them. Who wouldn\\'t seal a deal with you after having loads of fun together?",
    "1411": "When you have money, flies will swarm around you. But flies can also be fun, don\\'t you think?",
    "1412": "I have a friend, a painter, who admires my physique and uses me as a canvas. Body art! You understand art? Though it smudges off with one wipe of detergent, I like to keep my friend happy. That way, maybe he\\'ll buy a decade worth of paints from me...",
    "1413": "I haven\\'t been out for so long. My factory has taken a huge hit as a result. Chief, how will you compensate me?",
    "1414": "I don\\'t view greed as a sin. To feel satisfied when you get what you want, to feel happy when you see things go your way... Isn\\'t this human nature?",
    "1415": "Talking about money is the most boring part of business. I prefer something else... like offering a deal that cannot be refused, then watching the other person hand over something they cherish deeply with a look of utmost pain and despair... Now that is addictive.",
    "1416": "I\\'ve been wondering what your deepest desire is... what must I rob you of to enjoy a look of remorse and despair on your face? But I give up, because you are just like me. There is a bottomless void in your heart... Hahahaha.",
    "1417": "I haven\\'t sealed a single deal since coming here?! No... I gotta find Faye tomorrow... She\\'s beautiful inside and out. Surely she will do something about this!",
    "1418": "200 for one time... Just kidding, I wouldn\\'t dream of sealing such a petty deal with you! If you sign this contract, feel free to touch whenever you want! It\\'s all on me!",
    "1419": "Are you here to discuss business? Wait a bit, I\\'m busy watching this livestream. Hehe, this girl ain\\'t bad. Let me send her some gifts...",
    "1420": "What a coincidence! I happen to have a friend there. Leave it to him!",
    "1421": "Hello? Oh, it\\'s done? Great! Chief, it\\'s done over there! Everything went according to plan!",
    "1422": "I don\\'t need to pay for this? Are you serious?",
    "1423": "You go to such dangerous places just for fun? Wow, you have my respect.",
    "1424": "Hey hey hey, be careful.",
    "1425": "It\\'s on me! Nothing will go wrong.",
    "1426": "(Grunts)",
    "1427": "(Bellows)",
    "1428": "Hmm?",
    "1429": "Oh that scared me...",
    "1430": "There\\'s nothing fun about becoming strong in and of itself, but after becoming strong, you will have more ways to seek out fun.",
    "1431": "You took the trouble to bring me all the way here... Is it because you are insecure with that face of yours? Don\\'t worry, at least your eyes are not bad.",
    "1432": "I don\\'t mind getting stronger, but is it really necessary?",
    "1433": "Mirrors can reveal the human heart. Tell me, what reflection do you see in my mirror? A human figure, or just greed and lust?",
    "1434": "Come. Let me see if you\\'re still salvageable.",
    "1435": "Don\\'t laugh too hard, or else your eyes will get wrinkles.",
    "1436": "A deserter and a stray. What a match made in heaven.",
    "1437": "Look how hideous you are!",
    "1438": "I have to... bring her back...",
    "1439": "Your eyes are as pretty as always. Calm down... with these shackles around, I won\\'t do anything to you.",
    "1440": "Keep everything where it should be. You can\\'t even do that?",
    "1441": "What beautiful proportions. This face is clearly their greatest asset. Why are they in a rush to sell it?",
    "1442": "My mirror reveals one\\'s greatest desires, yet I can\\'t seem to see yours. Chief, is there really nothing you desire... or are they not to be seen?",
    "1443": "In Eastside, where people live and die for entertainment, a pretty face is a ticket to the party. Yet there is a price to pay to realize this dream. We\\'re both in this game for something we want.",
    "1444": "The star of tomorrow? Ha, you like that mass-produced trash? I don\\'t even need my power to know what they want. It\\'s always the same look... They\\'re worse than Corruptors. At least Corruptors are each hideous in their own ways.",
    "1445": "Appearances can be tweaked and changed, but eyes cannot. Eyes become worthless once the light in them dies out... but yours are different. Want to give them to me? I\\'ll try to be as gentle as possible.",
    "1446": "You remind me of someone... Sincere, passionate, and with scorching eyes only for me. May I keep your eyes forever, too?",
    "1447": "...All I\\'m missing is a pair of eyes. Wait a bit longer. I\\'ll bring you back soon...",
    "1448": "I want you to be close to me... but not this close. Control yourself and mind your manners. Adjutant Nightingale hasn\\'t left yet.",
    "1449": "Am I the most special one in your eyes?",
    "1450": "Services other than surgery? That\\'s not included in the price. Remember to pay separately in full.",
    "1451": "Hmm? This trash makes you happy?",
    "1452": "That\\'s all? This is just some cheap stuff.",
    "1453": "You\\'ve got some nerve to show me all those hideous things.",
    "1454": "Get out of here!",
    "1455": "Got it.",
    "1456": "(Grunts)",
    "1457": "(Bellows)",
    "1458": "Huh?",
    "1459": "! ...Tsk.",
    "1460": "I don\\'t mind getting stronger, but is it really necessary?",
    "1461": "You guys at MBCC are so petty. I just mentioned on my stream that I\\'m a Sinner, and within an hour you\\'re knocking on my door! (Looks around) Ahem... But this place looks pretty nice. Should be a good place for streaming!",
    "1462": "Hey, how come this training dummy can\\'t take a hit...",
    "1463": "Hmph... How could a mere MBCC stop a genius like Nino Sama? It\\'s just a simple signal connection... Huh?! EDGE warning email?",
    "1464": "Follow Nino Sama well and don\\'t get blown away by the wind!",
    "1465": "Ha, worthless mobs, what makes you think you can beat me?",
    "1466": "...If you suck, just git gud.",
    "1467": "Here I come!",
    "1468": "Am I going to... sleep alone again...",
    "1469": "Ta-da, it\\'s Nino\\'s game time, live at 7 p.m. every day! You\\'ll get some amazing gameplay with sharp commentary here. Come and follow me!",
    "1470": "Sigh... There\\'s no good games lately, I\\'m even thinking about replaying \\\\\"Codename: Dark.\\\\\" The graphics look like they\\'re from the last century, but it\\'s not so bad once you get into it. Hmm... just like blue cheese, smells bad but tastes good!",
    "1471": "Where am I streaming right now? Ahaha... I\\'m at home, of course! Those guys at MBCC are useless, they can\\'t keep me! (Turns off the mic and whispers) Shh! Don\\'t say anything!",
    "1472": "Ahhh... I\\'m so mad! Why is this DisMyth admin banning me, and during my live stream at that! All I did was repost the silly things she said years ago, why doesn\\'t she do anything when other people do it?! She\\'s targeting me!",
    "1473": "Un-understood... I can\\'t resist Chief\\'s command... As long as you have the shackles, I\\'ll do no matter what you... you don\\'t want me to do! Hahaha, I\\'m just messing with you! Look at you, so nervous, what a wimp!",
    "1474": "Seriously?! You are that bad, huh? Use counter attack with the shield! Give me the controller. I\\'ll clear it for you! Let go! Let go! If you don\\'t let go, I\\'m going to get on top of you and teach you how to play!",
    "1475": "When I\\'m with you, even if we don\\'t do anything, I never feel bored... Hmmm... I didn\\'t realize the day flew by this quickly. Could you lend me your shoulder to lean on, and please don\\'t leave me before I fall asleep, okay?",
    "1476": "Ah, don\\'t close this yet! There are... some things that are a bit awkward to say to your face... I might be able to be more serious if we talk like this. I-I\\'m being really honest here! I know I tease you and complain a lot. But it\\'s all because I want you to pay more attention to me... After all, I-I\\'m really afraid of being alone... If there\\'s no one to talk to me, to keep me company, I\\'d definitely die of loneliness... Don-don\\'t laugh! I\\'m being serious!",
    "1477": "You seem pretty free today, don\\'t you have work? All finished? Hmph, you can watch me stream on this VIP seat then.",
    "1478": "Cut it out. I\\'m streaming! ...Ahem, sorry, my pet just snuck in. Where was I? Can someone remind me?",
    "1479": "Hehe, I knew it. You don\\'t like being alone. You want me to keep you company, right?",
    "1480": "You need me to run errands for you again? Sigh... let\\'s just say I\\'m too soft-hearted.",
    "1481": "Here, these are the things you wanted. Hey! They\\'re not for free, say \\\\\"Thank you for your kindness, Nino Sama\\\\\".",
    "1482": "That\\'s not enough. I should be able to fight a hundred Corruptors at least.",
    "1483": "It would be a waste not to let me live stream such a fun event!",
    "1484": "I told you not to run off!",
    "1485": "Ah... Ah, okay, okay, I get it!",
    "1486": "(Grunts)",
    "1487": "Ha!",
    "1488": "Yes?",
    "1489": "(Gasps)",
    "1490": "Hey, how come this training dummy can\\'t take a hit...",
    "1491": "You... are the one who imprisoned us. I remember your scent, I\\'ll spot you wherever you are.",
    "1492": "Be honest, do you want me, or a beast?",
    "1493": "Now that you\\'ve granted me power, don\\'t let me loose again—one moment will be too much.",
    "1494": "Get ready. There will be blood.",
    "1495": "Too soon, you scum, you gave up too soon!",
    "1496": "Let me go. It\\'s not over yet! Let go!",
    "1497": "Ah!",
    "1498": "Am I... finally free?",
    "1499": "I knew it was you. I recognize your footsteps.",
    "1500": "They wanted my arms, wanted my blood, wanted me to tear everything down. They wanted to create a monster, and I was <i>the masterpiece<\/i>.",
    "1501": "My blade has sliced many. Among them, Hella is not the strongest, but she\\'s the toughest.",
    "1502": "In that blood-boiling moment, the body acts on instinct. Don\\'t think, forget whoever you\\'ve torn apart, simply—enjoy it. That\\'s how I\\'m designed.",
    "1503": "Chains? They\\'re nothing. I\\'m used to them. Also, I can get rid of them anytime I want.",
    "1504": "I don\\'t care how others call me. But I do like <i>Ninety-Nine<\/i>... It\\'s the first name I\\'ve ever been given.",
    "1505": "I don\\'t remember much about Parma. Only Hella\\'s voice in the dark. She kept talking to me, telling me about Syndicate, what\\'s above the ground, people. She said she\\'d take me with her.",
    "1506": "You\\'re the second person I\\'ve wanted to kill but couldn\\'t. From now on, I\\'ll keep on fighting for you, until the day I die.",
    "1507": "...I\\'m hungry.",
    "1508": "What... Do you want a fight?",
    "1509": "Yeah, keep an eye on me, like how I\\'m watching you.",
    "1510": "I\\'ll... do my best.",
    "1511": "It\\'s done, as you instructed.",
    "1512": "Interesting.",
    "1513": "Are you... trying to comfort me?",
    "1514": "I can feel my blood boiling.",
    "1515": "Mmm!",
    "1516": "Mmm.",
    "1517": "Hmph.",
    "1518": "(Cries out)",
    "1519": "Hmm?",
    "1520": "Huh?!",
    "1521": "Be honest, do you want me, or a beast?",
    "1522": "I\\'m... Parma\\'s living weapon, Ninety-Nine. Fight... Give me orders, I only need to fight...",
    "1523": "I\\'m stronger now... I\\'ll give them a quick death.",
    "1524": "You\\'re here... When does the next fight start?",
    "1525": "Fight, fight endlessly, until one side falls...",
    "1526": "Pain distracts you, so if you want to survive, you must get used to pain.",
    "1527": "You seem to be here all the time. What\\'s your purpose?",
    "1528": "Grrr... Grrr...",
    "1529": "If it\\'s not for a fight, what are you here for? Am I useful in other ways?",
    "1530": "I like... the soft touch, the rotting smell, and the crunching sound of things breaking apart, hehehe... Chief... can you satisfy me?",
    "1531": "This chainsaw is razor-sharp... better be careful... hahahaha!",
    "1532": "Hehehe... I can smell the Rust.",
    "1533": "Where? Corruptors, monsters...! Don\\'t try to escape!",
    "1534": "Ha... mission accomplished!",
    "1535": "I won\\'t let you get away!",
    "1536": "Hahahaha! Does it hurt?! Does it hurt?!",
    "1537": "I will... personally bury myself...!",
    "1538": "Hahaha... seems like you want to cozy up to me... aren\\'t you afraid I\\'ll dismember you?",
    "1539": "Is your body feeling stiff? How about I help you reassemble it?",
    "1540": "How do y\\'all refer to me? The reaper, the chainsaw maniac? Hehe... well my favorite nickname is... the undertaker.",
    "1541": "Better be careful if you\\'re their lapdog. Someday, you\\'ll be mercilessly abandoned too... hahaha!",
    "1542": "Traitors... traitors must be killed mercilessly and thrown into the Rust. Hehe... I won\\'t betray you, so... don\\'t betray me either.",
    "1543": "The sun rises and sets, and the chainsaw starts to churn... all the filth before my eyes dissolve into smithereens... let us purify, let us bury... graves are piling up by the Rust, overlooking DisCity...",
    "1544": "I buried all my companions in the Rust. I can still vaguely remember... their silhouettes.",
    "1545": "I\\'ve made my decision. I will build my tomb near here, and you shall be the one to see me off. Chief... when the time comes, can you write my epitaph?",
    "1546": "Shush... I can hear the Corruptors... in the distance! No... behind you!",
    "1547": "You seem interested in my body... which body part do you like? I will give it to you!",
    "1548": "You\\'ve got a sharp eye... almost as if you\\'re going to slice me open... hehehe... it seems like we\\'ll get along just fine.",
    "1549": "Hehe, alright! I miss the little monsters from the Rust...",
    "1550": "Feels so much better now that the dirty things have been dealt with, hehe.",
    "1551": "Ah... the sound of a churning chainsaw is music to my ears!",
    "1552": "Hmm? How come the dead can talk?",
    "1553": "Hmm?",
    "1554": "Pffft!",
    "1555": "Humph!",
    "1556": "Ha!",
    "1557": "Hmm?",
    "1558": "Hmm?!",
    "1559": "This chainsaw is razor-sharp... better be careful... hahahaha!",
    "1560": "Scream and cower in fear, traitors! Enjoy your last moments—\\\\\"Chainsaw Wendy\\\\\" is here! You can\\'t get away from me!",
    "1561": "I can hang some more pieces on my hook!",
    "1562": "The game is about to start. The rules are quite simple. All you have to do is run fast enough and hide well enough to avoid getting dismembered by me!",
    "1563": "What\\'s so scary about the killers in horror flicks? People are much more dangerous in real life.",
    "1564": "A lot of people don\\'t realize that life should never be taken for granted... I\\'ll teach them that lesson.",
    "1565": "Hide well, little bunny... Wendy is coming to get you! Don\\'t scream when you see her... or else she\\'ll cut off your tongue...",
    "1566": "Hahahaha... you still want to go on living after doing such things?",
    "1567": "Hahaha, you found me! Let\\'s play a little game. Don\\'t be nervous. As long as you try hard enough and give up some things, you have a chance of surviving.",
    "1568": "Come, say hi to my old friends.",
    "1569": "Ah, the sound of the chainsaw brings back memories...",
    "1570": "Shh... It\\'s quiet here at the Rust. Everyone\\'s asleep... Don\\'t you wake them.",
    "1571": "The touch and warmth feel familiar... I think I once had that too... You\\'re probably the only one who\\'ll give me head pats now.",
    "1572": "Not a single person will come and chill by the Rust. There are only Corruptors and monsters around here... Hehe, and a weirdo who keeps the Undertaker company.",
    "1573": "The dark cape can hide the filth and can be simply discarded. Who\\'ll give a disposable lapdog an expensive leash?",
    "1574": "I must keep these names safe. This way, at least somebody will remember us... Is there really a place where the Undertakers belong?",
    "1575": "My friends are all asleep. One day, I\\'ll lie beside them and rest in this filthy home of ours... When the day comes, will you bring me flowers too?",
    "1576": "Listen... The wind\\'s whistling by the Rust, saying goodnight...",
    "1577": "You smell like the Rust. Is it because you always watch me like this? Hehe... You\\'re indeed... my friend...",
    "1578": "My name is Pacassi... I\\'m an orphan of the old generation, a walking contaminant. Please keep your distance.",
    "1579": "Energy level boosted. Please upgrade your radiation protection accordingly.",
    "1580": "You still haven\\'t given up... Then, touch me... and prepare to be pierced through by radiation.",
    "1581": "I won\\'t let you down.",
    "1582": "I did it.",
    "1583": "I\\'m sorry... I\\'m really sorry...",
    "1584": "Get away... from me!",
    "1585": "At last... it\\'s over.",
    "1586": "Hello, Chief. Do you have any work for me today?",
    "1587": "Is there anything I can help with, Chief? I\\'m not used to staying idle and doing nothing.",
    "1588": "The modification on this arm is to help the muscles exert force... Sorry, but please don\\'t touch it. No, it\\'s not forbidden. It\\'s just that... it has absorbed too much radiation.",
    "1589": "I must live on, and remember everything that happened in the town. Otherwise, everything we\\'d experienced will be meaningless...",
    "1590": "I still remember the last accident with the power station. That winter, the snow ruined the greater part of the grid. In thirty days, the town\\'s population reduced by a quarter. We only found them under the melted snow when the spring came the next year...",
    "1591": "<i>Mayek<\/i> means lighthouse. Even in the darkest hour, it provides the wanderers with guidance and hope. But no one knows, that even the lighthouse itself can be devoured by darkness...",
    "1592": "I never dream of pity from others, not even from you. I... don\\'t want to live without dignity, as an experimental subject or an exotic animal on display...",
    "1593": "No one has ever told me what <i>friendship<\/i> means... I\\'ve read it in a book, that a friend is someone you would die for... If that\\'s true, then you\\'re my friend, my only friend.",
    "1594": "...You\\'ve been working for hours, Chief. Don\\'t you want to take a break?",
    "1595": "Chief... Is this... how people in the DisCity show friendliness? Hmm... Okay.",
    "1596": "Could you... stop staring at me? I... I\\'m not very used to it.",
    "1597": "I\\'ll get it done.",
    "1598": "I\\'ve finished my work. Please give me a new task.",
    "1599": "The radiation has become stronger.",
    "1600": "I\\'m used to battles. I can certainly do it.",
    "1601": "Watch out!",
    "1602": "Okay.",
    "1603": "(Grunts)",
    "1604": "(Bellows)",
    "1605": "Hmm?",
    "1606": "Oh.",
    "1607": "Energy level boosted. Please upgrade your radiation protection accordingly.",
    "1608": "Chief, please move closer to the fire. Even the outskirts of Mayek are much colder than DisCity. Take care and stay warm.",
    "1609": "Hmm, it\\'s very warm.",
    "1610": "Chief, do you feel warmer now? If you\\'re still feeling cold... have some of the borscht I\\'ve just cooked.",
    "1611": "\\\\\"A hundred years have passed. The young city has become the treasure and marvel of the Northern nation...\\\\\" I found this poetry collection in Bureau\\'s library. It\\'s very interesting... Care to read it, Chief?",
    "1612": "This was once the furthest I\\'d been from Mayek. And now... it\\'s also the closest I\\'ve been to it.",
    "1613": "When I was little, I always hoped winter could pass sooner. But now, I wish it could stay longer... Human beings are indeed strange.",
    "1614": "I... I only added some Mayek-style cutting and materials to the uniform. I suppose... I haven\\'t violated the Bureau\\'s rules, have I...?",
    "1615": "Bone-chilling winds and snowy nights are unique to Mayek, and those who stand firm in winter nights in snow gear deserve to stay in our memories eternally too...",
    "1616": "You caught me again! Fine then. I\\'ll keep hitting the Corruptors\\' heads like baseballs. After all, they were the ones who made me like this.",
    "1617": "Such strong power... if only I could control it.",
    "1618": "I\\'ve become this strong already? If only I were as strong when I was back on the Eastside baseball fields.",
    "1619": "Oh... is this area considered out?",
    "1620": "Easier than a bunt.",
    "1621": "Despicable! A bunt...",
    "1622": "Home run!",
    "1623": "What does it even matter... if I\\'m stronger?! Arghh!",
    "1624": "When will it be my turn to play?",
    "1625": "Prepare some extra baseball bats. The ones from the purchasing office aren\\'t enough. They won\\'t survive a single battle.",
    "1626": "Hey, isn\\'t this my fake Eastside identity from way back? Cough... back then, I had to get it to compete in a game.",
    "1627": "It\\'s hard for me to control my emotions. If you find me in unusually high or low spirits, be sure to steer clear. Don\\'t blame me for not warning you if you get beaten to a pulp.",
    "1628": "Isn\\'t the sound of batting a baseball music to the ears? Right? I fell in love with baseball the moment I heard that!",
    "1629": "Can I skip the mission in Eastside? It\\'s not that I\\'m scared, I just don\\'t like that place... Of course, if we can watch an Eastside Baseball League game afterwards, you can ignore what I just said.",
    "1630": "There\\'s a Syndicate baseball game tomorrow, do you want to watch the live stream together? If you don\\'t understand baseball, I can be your commentator.",
    "1631": "If possible, I really want to challenge the stronger teams... with you here, I think I can control my power. Hey, how about we try it sometime on the baseball field?",
    "1632": "Ah... can you ask the purchasing office to bring me some posters for this baseball tournament? No, I don\\'t play... but I can collect just the same!",
    "1633": "Hey! Didn\\'t we agree to keep some distance?",
    "1634": "Good eye! Just like a focused baseball champ.",
    "1635": "Start running to the next base!",
    "1636": "Safe!",
    "1637": "... I\\'m strong enough already.",
    "1638": "Prepare to bat.",
    "1639": "They\\'re coming... the Corruptors... are coming!",
    "1640": "I understand...",
    "1641": "(Hiss...)",
    "1642": "(Bellows)",
    "1643": "Hmm?",
    "1644": "Ah!",
    "1645": "Such strong power... if only I could control it.",
    "1646": "Here again?! Let me out! The Legion won\\'t let you off! My boss will come and crash this dump. You hear me?!",
    "1647": "Wow, this power... Let me try it out on Boss Zoya now!",
    "1648": "From now on, leave the Legion to me.",
    "1649": "Don\\'t worry. I\\'ve got you covered.",
    "1650": "Humph, now you know I\\'m not to be messed with.",
    "1651": "It\\'s okay. As long as we\\'re still alive, we have a chance to win!",
    "1652": "Ah!",
    "1653": "We... won\\'t lose...",
    "1654": "Yo, you\\'re here? I\\'m warming up. Wanna join me? A great warrior should never neglect training, or their body will get stiff. That\\'s what Boss Zoya taught me!",
    "1655": "We both came out of the same mother, why is Earl so tall... Wait and see, I\\'ll outgrow him.",
    "1656": "The secret to being strong? Training, unrelenting courage, and a liter of milk per day... What are you laughing at?! Nutrition\\'s important!",
    "1657": "My bros at the Legion gave me this axe. What do you think? It goes with my bravery and invincibility, right?",
    "1658": "Boss Zoya is incredibly strong, thoughtful, and brainy. I wish I could be like her someday. Well, I\\'d be happy if I\\'m half as good as she is.",
    "1659": "Dress? I don\\'t wear dresses. They\\'re inconvenient to fight in and very revealing. You... You liar! I wasn\\'t staring at the dress in the window last time... Shut up!",
    "1660": "I\\'m strong now and will no longer be a burden to anyone. But the person I cared about the most isn\\'t there anymore.",
    "1661": "You were lying when you said Boss Zoya sent you to save me, right? Humph. Fine, I forgive you. I won\\'t repeat the stupid mistake of... bickering with important people over little things.",
    "1662": "Hey, do you know where the Supply Office is? That purple-haired chick said she is getting rid of the soon out-of-date mil... merchandise. 50% off for everything. Let me go check it out.",
    "1663": "Ah! Don\\'t run! I\\'ll chop your head off!",
    "1664": "What did you come to see me for? Just to look at me? What\\'s there to look at? Or are you here to train with me?",
    "1665": "Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll take care of it.",
    "1666": "You\\'ve asked me to help now. Isn\\'t this just a piece of cake or what?",
    "1667": "Yes! Give me some more.",
    "1668": "Legion, let\\'s go!",
    "1669": "Be careful!",
    "1670": "Roger.",
    "1671": "(Grunts)",
    "1672": "(Bellows)",
    "1673": "Hmm?",
    "1674": "Ahhhhhh!!",
    "1675": "Wow, this power... Let me try it out on Boss Zoya now!",
    "1676": "...Why are you here? Just to check on me? What\\'s there to check? Well, since you\\'re here, why not work out with me for a bit? Do you see how skinny you are? I\\'m worried a gust of wind from DisSea might blow you away one day.",
    "1677": "(Gulp) Ah! Nothing beats a glass of milk after a good workout!",
    "1678": "Do you know what time it is already? Still hanging around here, huh? A top-notch warrior never skimps on training! Come on, let\\'s run 2 miles to warm up.",
    "1679": "Hmm... Five sets of lat pulldowns, five sets of reverse grip lat pulldowns, five sets of dumbbell curls, and five sets of barbell curls. This is just the workout plan for the first phase. After we finish these, we can... Hey, where are you going? Fine, we\\'ll start with three sets. Three sets, okay?",
    "1680": "What\\'s that saying again? Something about... quantity leading to... some kind of change... Ugh, I can\\'t remember! Anyway, the point is, consistent training is definitely the right way to go! One day, I\\'ll surpass him and even Boss Zoya to become the strongest in the Legion!",
    "1681": "Ugh, this strawberry flavor is way too strong, it\\'s sickeningly sweet... O-of course, I know egg albumen powder should be mixed with water, but don\\'t you want to know what the powder tastes like?!",
    "1682": "Hey, watch it! This jacket cost me a pretty penny. It\\'s not just any jacket, it\\'s the soul of the Legion! You want to try it on? Alright, considering your respect for the Legion, I\\'ll... Uh... Wait! Let me wash it first...",
    "1683": "How are you supposed to work out with me dressed like that? Come on, let\\'s head back to the Legion. I\\'ll let them get you something comfortable.",
    "1684": "So this is your Chief? Are you serious? Looks like such a weakling! I\\'d never take orders from someone like this... hey, stop tugging my bag!",
    "1685": "Better weapons, superior combat!",
    "1686": "Feast your eyes upon the weapons for slaying gods!",
    "1687": "A good weapon is a battle-seasoned weapon, no?",
    "1688": "Aw, I got splashed... Next time, you guys fight. I\\'ll just watch from the side.",
    "1689": "Can\\'t even win this? See you in hell.",
    "1690": "Offense taken.",
    "1691": "The nightmare is finally over...",
    "1692": "Don\\'t rush me. I\\'ll send it to you when it\\'s done... Oh, it\\'s you.",
    "1693": "Wow, that new voodoo doll is adorable! I want to cut it up and throw it into the stove as fuel. Mmmm... I\\'m making an order now!",
    "1694": "I would never use something ugly like a forging press! Wielding exquisitely handcrafted masterpieces feels totally different from thrashing about mass-produced garbage.",
    "1695": "I despise the lawyers, execs, and politicians in Eastside the most. They talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? I don\\'t think they can\\'t afford to buy a weapon.",
    "1696": "Guns are cool, but I still prefer cold weapons. Woosh! Swish! Splat! And your enemy is gone! It\\'s so romantic.",
    "1697": "I\\'ve been observing you for a long time. You really don\\'t have an ounce of malice in you. It\\'s bizarre... How can someone truly have no desire to hurt others...?",
    "1698": "Is there any conflict between loving cute things and loving violence? To me, they\\'re the cutest when going at each other\\'s throats with hatred and malice. Don\\'t you think so?",
    "1699": "What I want to kill is far more terrifying than you can imagine. Humans are simply worms before Him... you still want to tag along? Ooh, you look so cute when you try to act tough!",
    "1700": "Hmm, the knife\\'s spine is straight enough, and the balance is on point. Now, on to the handle...",
    "1701": "Stop! Do that one more time, and I\\'ll chuck you into the stove as firewood!",
    "1702": "Oh, you come in person today! You know, the orders are usually placed by your adjutant. What could be the reason? Do you also want a deadly weapon? Hehe, you\\'ve finally come to your senses.",
    "1703": "Sure, I can run this errand for you. Just look after my workshop and don\\'t let anyone in.",
    "1704": "It\\'s done. Too bad the two didn\\'t fight each other, sigh...",
    "1705": "Craftsmanship upgraded!",
    "1706": "Heh heh, fight! Fight!",
    "1707": "Don\\'t go over there!",
    "1708": "Okay.",
    "1709": "(Grunts)",
    "1710": "(Bellows)",
    "1711": "Uh-huh?",
    "1712": "Ahhh!",
    "1713": "Better weapons, superior combat!",
    "1714": "Visiting my shop at such a late hour... Do you have something good that you\\'re eager to pawn? Or do you want to trade something? ...Hehe, I can do both, as long as you\\'re sure you won\\'t regret it. After all, you can\\'t redeem what\\'s pawned here.",
    "1715": "This is in decent condition, I\\'ll take it.",
    "1716": "My clothes are special? Of course they are. They\\'ve been with me for a very, very long time. The one who pawned it has long been gone. You don\\'t see genuine antiques like this every day. Want to come closer and take a good look?",
    "1717": "Hey, don\\'t touch it! This paper octopus only likes its owner, and it\\'s got a bad temper... Pawnshop rule No.1: keep your hands and questions to yourself. Don\\'t ask what you shouldn\\'t ask, and don\\'t touch what you shouldn\\'t touch. If you accidentally provoke something, I \\\\\"can\\\\\" guarantee your safety~",
    "1718": "Hmm? For me? ...What! Garlic chips?! Ahhh, don\\'t come any closer! Are you trying to please me or hurt me?! Ahhh... You\\'re definitely doing this on purpose!",
    "1719": "It\\'s fine to wander around in the hall, but don\\'t go behind the counter. You won\\'t like what\\'s there. I\\'m warning you: curiosity killed the cats.",
    "1720": "Oh? You want to peel off this yellow paper? Hehe, I don\\'t know what will happen either, why not give it a try?",
    "1721": "From the moment you walked in, you\\'ve laid your eyes only on me. If you really want to take something out from the pawnshop, pick up the ritual sword on the ground and subdue me!",
    "1722": "Haha, so you actually managed to shackle me. Looks like you do have some tricks up your sleeve... What a refreshing challenge. I accept your duel!",
    "1723": "Ha! Prepare to get torn apart by the mad dog!",
    "1724": "Now, I stand at the apex, waiting to be challenged by you all!",
    "1725": "C\\'mon, let\\'s fight!",
    "1726": "Yeah... Yeah! Kneel and beg for mercy! Just like that!",
    "1727": "Don\\'t get cocky! I\\'ll win everything back!",
    "1728": "Have a taste of this!",
    "1729": "Ha... A gladiator should die... on the battlefield...",
    "1730": "Let\\'s have a fight! If you beat me, I\\'ll consider letting you through to the office.",
    "1731": "Why do I fight so hard on the field? Haha, no reason! I just like to win!",
    "1732": "Law of the jungle? Ha! Brawn is shit in fights. You\\'ve got to use your brain to win!",
    "1733": "What\\'s the \\\\\"Syndicate Spirit\\\\\"? Winner takes all, that\\'s what! Only fools care about ethics. For me, the end justifies the means.",
    "1734": "Mmm... You\\'re a smart cookie. You\\'re way more interesting than those brutes who are all brawn and no brains.",
    "1735": "Those guys who used to surround me were like dogs wagging their tails for a treat, so I dealt with them like the dogs they were... Why the frown? I don\\'t mean you!",
    "1736": "Back in the arena, they always looked at me in disgust, as if I were a mad dog. Yet they also feared me to death. I like the way you look at me... you\\'re not like them.",
    "1737": "I\\'ve only ever fought for myself, but you\\'re a smart cookie who managed to \\\\\"shackle\\\\\" me... Then, my strength may also bring you victory.",
    "1738": "Hey, come and throw a few shots at me. I feel like I\\'m getting rusty!",
    "1739": "Pfft, you also want to taste some nails?",
    "1740": "What are you looking at? Wanna fight?",
    "1741": "Where\\'s the fight?",
    "1742": "Here, these are the spoils today. Tsk, those chickens fled before I had enough fun.",
    "1743": "Yeah, just like that! Fight! Keep fighting!",
    "1744": "It\\'s finally my turn on the battlefield!",
    "1745": "Scared?",
    "1746": "Hmph.",
    "1747": "Urgh...",
    "1748": "Huh!",
    "1749": "Yes?",
    "1750": "Tsk tsk.",
    "1751": "Ha! Prepare to get torn apart by the mad dog!",
    "1752": "You\\'ve got some nerve, treating a gladiator like a guard dog. And just make sure to keep a tight grip on that leash of yours, or else... I might bite someone you\\'d rather I didn\\'t.",
    "1753": "That\\'s not enough. I need a few more reckless fools to sharpen my teeth on!",
    "1754": "Look, all I see here are a bunch of dressed-up softies. Will they really give me a good fight? \\'Cause if not, you better make it up to me when we get back.",
    "1755": "This outfit\\'s so uncomfortable. It barely has any room for anything... Seems like those scaredy-cat rich folks do have a brain after all. But this little trick won\\'t stop me... I\\'ve never tried using diamonds to fight before, let\\'s see if these rich folks\\' trinkets are up to the task of being my props!",
    "1756": "See that guy over there? He\\'s got a weird stench on him. I bet he\\'s got poison with him. And that one, he\\'s the type to hit first, and ask later. But his buddy won\\'t agree... How do I know all this? Ha, don\\'t play dumb. You brought me along because of my keen nose and sharp ears, didn\\'t you?",
    "1757": "We need to make a quick getaway? This route is the shortest. There are people in the way... That path ahead is blocked... Damn, planning an escape before the fight even starts is a new low for me... But this is an exception. Don\\'t even think about making me do this ever again!",
    "1758": "Hey, hey, hey, you\\'re all flustered just from loosening a collar. You can\\'t even handle this? Hey, you big oaf! Which hand did you touch my boss with? You don\\'t want to keep it anymore!",
    "1759": "No need to keep such a close eye on me... I won\\'t run, and I won\\'t cause any trouble. After all, you\\'re the one holding the leash... What are you worried about?",
    "1760": "Mhmm... The righteous MBCC Chief who destroys Black Rings and takes down Corruptors... Ahem, I\\'ve decided—you\\'ll be my assistant! We\\'re gonna crack tons of big cases in DisCity together!",
    "1761": "\\\\\"I\\'m Christina, the Eastside Acting Inspector who leaves no cases unsolved!\\\\\" What do you think? Do I sound like a great detective?",
    "1762": "\\\\\"To find justice is to stare the truth in the face,\\\\\" they say. Now I can finally practice that.",
    "1763": "Mhmm... Well! ...What was the first step again? Let me check my notebook...",
    "1764": "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth!",
    "1765": "Chin up, assistant! I\\'ll always be with you during our quest for justice!",
    "1766": "Truth is power!",
    "1767": "Sorry... I couldn\\'t...",
    "1768": "My dear assistant, you\\'re just in time! Well... Are there any spare band-aids in the Bureau? If yes, can you do me a favor and put one on my wound?",
    "1769": "Alas, this month\\'s repair and compensation bill is huge! I-I swear I didn\\'t break them on purpose! They... they got in the way of my investigation!",
    "1770": "What? The door to the Sinner\\'s training room is broken? And the AC is acting up too? Those trapped inside are gonna die from the heat! Ahem, this must be a locked-room mystery! I\\'m gonna get to the bottom of this!",
    "1771": "Taking notes on electronic devices will ruin your eyes! If you end up with blurry vision, don\\'t come crying to me! Here, take my notebook and fountain pen. You\\'ll be better off using them for your notes!",
    "1772": "I saw this really cool detective at the Public Security Bureau the other day. They called him Doyle! ...What\\'s so funny? He used to be different? In-interesting. I\\'m gonna look into it.",
    "1773": "Assistant, what would you do if your little sister never calls you \\'big sis\\'... Should you swallow your pride and call her \\'lil sis\\' first, or... should you write her a letter to say you\\'re sorry... something like that?",
    "1774": "There was someone who would always lend me an ear, embrace all parts of me, and guide me just like you. That was once the whole world to me...",
    "1775": "Thank you, my assistant, for always being by my side. The road to justice is bound to be long and difficult, but I will give my all for the light at the end. Even so, will you still follow me? Hah, I know you will. Then take my hand and march forward!",
    "1776": "Aha! I knew my hunch was right! My dear assistant, quit lazing around in the office, and let\\'s get out there and solve some cases!",
    "1777": "I made the notebook so heavy, just for... someone like you!",
    "1778": "My dear assistant, are you drooling over my gadgets? Do you wanna try this mini voice changer or this air pistol? Mm-mm, no touch before taking tutorials. Want me to teach you?",
    "1779": "Huh? A new case? Let me help! Let me help!",
    "1780": "Acting Inspector Christina has smashed—Ahh... I mean—solved the case!",
    "1781": "Another step closer to justice!",
    "1782": "Time for the Eastside Acting Inspector to shine!",
    "1783": "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",
    "1784": "Acting Inspector, ready to roll!",
    "1785": "Mmm (groans)",
    "1786": "Hey!",
    "1787": "Yes?",
    "1788": "Gasps",
    "1789": "\\\\\"I\\'m Christina, the Eastside Acting Inspector who leaves no cases unsolved!\\\\\" What do you think? Do I sound like a great detective?",
    "1790": "Leaving the Syndicate mob alone but locking up doctors who can save lives? Humph, what a depraved MBCC.",
    "1791": "I can see you\\'ve made an effort, but the robotic arm won\\'t fully integrate with the muscle nerves overnight.",
    "1792": "The dream of wiping out Mania will soon come true.",
    "1793": "Don\\'t touch the pollutant. Keep up.",
    "1794": "The surgery was successful.",
    "1795": "Protect the injured first! Retreat!",
    "1796": "Lesion removal!",
    "1797": "Patients still need me, I... can\\'t fall...",
    "1798": "Now that you\\'re here, get working. Don\\'t just stand around and waste time.",
    "1799": "When are you going to keep these Sinners in check? Brawling, getting drunk, gambling... It\\'s like a mini version of Syndicate, except no one gets killed.",
    "1800": "There is no such thing as a gift of medical talent. I know what I have to do.",
    "1801": "People don\\'t fear Mania itself, but the violence and death that it brings, and that is precisely why I must purge sinful thoughts.",
    "1802": "I have never forced a patient to remove their frontal lobe; they simply chose to live in the face of death.",
    "1803": "No clinician would want to see patients dying in front of them. Not me, and not Anne. So... forgive her.",
    "1804": "Turning into a brain-cutting demon to curb Mania is like sacrificing my left arm to stay sane. It\\'s a choice I weighed, and I have nothing to regret.",
    "1805": "Since you want to be in this with me, I must warn you—there\\'s no room for regret in frontal lobotomy, and it involves huge risks and blames to take Mania under control. Are you still willing to do this despite that?",
    "1806": "The criminals are rampant out there, yet the Chief of MBCC is taking a nap at work... It\\'s time to fix DisCity.",
    "1807": "You have excessive dopamine and need a cranial examination. I\\'m not joking. If you don\\'t believe me... try doing it again.",
    "1808": "You\\'re the first person without Mania that sees me regularly.",
    "1809": "Time is precious in treating Mania. Stop bothering me with trivial matters.",
    "1810": "Don\\'t thank me. I\\'m not interested in anything non-medical.",
    "1811": "You\\'re content with this? There\\'s still room for improvement. Keep going.",
    "1812": "I\\'ll just put it out there. I won\\'t save anyone who doesn\\'t follow medical advice.",
    "1813": "Danger!",
    "1814": "Okay.",
    "1815": "(Grunts)",
    "1816": "(Bellows)",
    "1817": "What?",
    "1818": "Huh?!",
    "1819": "I can see you\\'ve made an effort, but the robotic arm won\\'t fully integrate with the muscle nerves overnight.",
    "1820": "What are you looking at? Today I\\'m on special duty, so I look a bit different. Don\\'t worry, come in.",
    "1821": "Sutures confirmed. Keep going.",
    "1822": "Lie down over there. Let me see if I need to hammer a few surgical screws into that weak, wobbly body of yours.",
    "1823": "Anne suggested that I should loosen up a bit and try on some different clothes, so as not to scare the patients and hinder the diagnosis... Hmph, now it seems like a useless gimmick.",
    "1824": "Though we\\'re both medical professionals, I\\'m not like the scientist in the story who creates monsters from corpses. He wants to create life out of death, while I try to stop death from arriving altogether.",
    "1825": "The temperature in the room is fine. Why are all the patients shivering?",
    "1826": "No need to make a big deal about these stitches. They\\'re just painted on with pharmaceutical ink. If you like them so much, I\\'ll give you some real ones next time.",
    "1827": "Indeed, there are treatments that use metal to connect brain tissues so that the brain continues to function. Are you looking at me this way because you want to try it out?",
    "1828": "You actually invited a phantom robber inside... are you expecting me to steal something?",
    "1829": "In these few seconds, I\\'ll be watching you carefully.",
    "1830": "When you catch up with time, you will feel that you can change everything.",
    "1831": "I already know the other side\\'s plan like the back of my hand.",
    "1832": "I planned this operation, so naturally it is foolproof.",
    "1833": "Time\\'s up! Retreat!",
    "1834": "Time\\'s up!",
    "1835": "Ha... in a way, that\\'s also a type of escape.",
    "1836": "Hello, Chief of MBCC. Let me steal some of your time. Please, stop working for a moment. Let\\'s have a chat.",
    "1837": "When time is frozen, this hourglass is the only timekeeping device that will keep on churning.",
    "1838": "The more constrained I am during the day... the wilder I am at night... hehe...",
    "1839": "Speaking of that little bunny... Don\\'t you think she\\'s interesting? But she leaves behind too many traces. Rather than have someone else catch her, it\\'s better to... tie her to my side.",
    "1840": "I can trust my back entirely to Pricilla... Isn\\'t it romantic?",
    "1841": "Whether it\\'s Eastside or Paradeisos, under the glitzy facade, it\\'s all chains and shackles.",
    "1842": "Even though I\\'m imprisoned here... this place is actually quite free.",
    "1843": "I already have the most precious thing in the world. How about I leave behind my old ways right now? You\\'ll be my witness.",
    "1844": "Let times like these last a bit longer.",
    "1845": "Are you seeking some thrills, Chief?",
    "1846": "Don\\'t blink! Be careful. This little fox\\'s tricks can make you run around in circles.",
    "1847": "I can complete your mission perfectly, but... would I do it?",
    "1848": "I got this gift for you along the way. Hmm? It doesn\\'t count as a gift if it\\'s stolen?",
    "1849": "Yes... there\\'s room to improve.",
    "1850": "I\\'ll give you five seconds to flee.",
    "1851": "Humph!",
    "1852": "Okay.",
    "1853": "Ugh!",
    "1854": "(Bellows)",
    "1855": "Oh?",
    "1856": "Alas.",
    "1857": "In these few seconds, I\\'ll be watching you carefully.",
    "1858": "Don\\'t stand there like a fool! If we start running right now, we\\'ll still have a chance to get the stolen treasure back from that bunny thief.",
    "1859": "Everything is under control.",
    "1860": "Did I scare you with my entrance? But it\\'s the fastest route... Besides, it\\'s great fun to make a fuss at this hypocritical and flashy dinner party, isn\\'t it?",
    "1861": "I have no interest in joining your field. I only volunteered to participate because I happened to discover their manhunt plan while upgrading the internal system for the DisCity Public Security Bureau.",
    "1862": "Whoever sent that notice letter is clearly very confident, daringly leaving a trail of flower petals as her escape route... Is she secretly hoping to be caught?",
    "1863": "This direction... Ah, off to the terrace as expected. Care to guess why the security there is as loose as a breeze?",
    "1864": "If you don\\'t want to find something missing from your body later, behave yourself. Will ya, Chief?",
    "1865": "Stay close to me and I will keep you safe in this chaos.",
    "1866": "At last, we meet again... Sumire is the name of this flower, it\\'s also my name. It\\'d be my pleasure if you\\'d accept this as a gift.",
    "1867": "The deeper the roots, the more beautiful the flowers will be... Deadlier, too.",
    "1868": "This body of mine has bloomed. From this day on, I will be a sharp blade that only you could wield.",
    "1869": "Stay close to me.",
    "1870": "The victory belongs to you.",
    "1871": "This is all my fault, this is all my fault...",
    "1872": "Cherry blossoms are falling... And so will you!",
    "1873": "I\\'m sorry, farewell...",
    "1874": "Look, Chief, the tea leaves are standing. Could it be that pleasant surprises are awaiting us?",
    "1875": "Cut off living flowers, arrange them in shapes desired by humans, admire their elegance as they die... That is the art of ikebana. Sounds cruel, doesn\\'t it?",
    "1876": "It\\'s incredibly easy to kill a person. Too easy. Living, on the contrary, is hard...",
    "1877": "How enviable, that flowers are always thriving towards the sun. Me, I\\'m just a vermin hiding in the shadow... I don\\'t live up to my own name.",
    "1878": "Only as we part do I know, men perish, as flowers do.",
    "1879": "How extraordinary, being with you makes me want to believe in dreams, future and hope... Perhaps I\\'m no longer qualified to be an assassin.",
    "1880": "Since the first time I\\'d picked up a weapon, I\\'d never dared to dream of going back, until I met you... Promise me you\\'ll never leave me, please.",
    "1881": "I used to think it was already more than enough to just be next to you. It turns out that I\\'m far greedier than I thought.",
    "1882": "Are you asleep, Chief? You must be exhausted... Once I seize a chance, I\\'ll get rid of those guys who are in your way. When that\\'s done, you can have a good night\\'s sleep, alright?",
    "1883": "We\\'re still at work, Chief...",
    "1884": "You\\'re always busy dealing with others\\' problems, but you must have your own worries too, don\\'t you? If you don\\'t mind, please let me be your listener.",
    "1885": "Along this path, many have come and gone, and I am one of them.",
    "1886": "Birds return to their nests, as wilted flowers rejoin fallen leaves.",
    "1887": "The flowering season is nearing.",
    "1888": "I will never let you down.",
    "1889": "Please be careful.",
    "1890": "Sure, got it.",
    "1891": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1892": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1893": "Eh?",
    "1894": "Ah?!",
    "1895": "The deeper the roots, the more beautiful the flowers will be... Deadlier, too.",
    "1896": "Thank you for coming... The cherry blossoms are especially beautiful this year, so I couldn\\'t help but want to enjoy this scenery with you.",
    "1897": "Cherry blossoms are willing to bloom passionately for their admirers until the end of their lives, and so do I.",
    "1898": "You\\'re not late. It was me who arrived early at the thought of seeing you... Don\\'t worry. I was not bored at all, because I was just so happy to meet you soon.",
    "1899": "...What\\'s wrong? There are petals on my face? (Blushing) How embarrassing. Thank you for taking them off me.",
    "1900": "Only by choosing the right materials for flower arrangements and wearing the right clothes to view the cherry blossoms, shall one live up to the beauty of nature. So, what do you think of my outfit, Chief?",
    "1901": "Cherry blossoms are also known as the \\\\\"Flower of Fantasy,\\\\\" because they are as beautiful and illusory as dreams... much like this moment. The time spent with you is as intoxicatingly beautiful as a cherry blossom. Even if it\\'s as fragile and fleeting as a dream, I\\'m content.",
    "1902": "Come sit next to me. If you don\\'t mind, you can take a nap on my lap. I\\'ll hold the parasol over you...",
    "1903": "Three days since I last held your hand, now cherry blossoms have covered the land. People often quote this poem to express the passing of time... I wonder when I\\'ll ever get to go out with you again?",
    "1904": "Did you see that? The butterfly that just flew by had a petal on its wing...",
    "1905": "You keep looking at me and not at the cherry blossoms... Do you want to say something to me?",
    "1906": "Thank you for coming to enjoy this beautiful view with me... I\\'m certain that, each night after this night, whether it\\'s bright or dim, wax or wane, I will think of tonight, and the moon we enjoyed together.",
    "1907": "In the sameness of all nights, your kind words made this one incomparable.",
    "1908": "The moon hidden in the clouds just peeks out. Do you think it also awaits this romantic encounter with us here and now?",
    "1909": "\\\\\"The moon, alas, is no drinker of wine.\\\\\" Chief, how about I tell you a story unique to a moonlit night?",
    "1910": "When I was little, I once heard about a rumor that foxes often transform into humans when the moonlight is bright, and invite the fateful ones to stroll with them... Hmm? Do you think I\\'m a fox?",
    "1911": "Alone are the leaves and moon. Alone I hum the wistful tune.",
    "1912": "Emm, is it getting windy? Allow me, Chief. I don\\'t want you to catch a cold.",
    "1913": "If you only gaze at the moon, you might overlook the scenery that truly matters.",
    "1914": "These are the hands that arrested me? Your fingers are dexterous and strong. If only you could use them to paint for me... (Approaches) Of course, you could use them to do other things as well...",
    "1915": "Passing off fakes as the real thing? That\\'s just the basics of basics.",
    "1916": "Are you still willing to trust your own eyes?",
    "1917": "Be nice... Give me your hand. Don\\'t let those incompetent appraisers make your hand dirty.",
    "1918": "Sigh, what a pity. It\\'s too worthless to even warrant a fake.",
    "1919": "Oh no... They\\'ve spotted the flaw in the painting!",
    "1920": "Don\\'t blink. A mere moment separates real and fake!",
    "1921": "Ha, real or fake, dead or alive... I\\'ve stopped caring long ago...",
    "1922": "How come you came back so late? I almost went to ask someone else for company... Hey, I\\'m kidding. Those people out there are just counterfeits. No one else can replace you.",
    "1923": "Hmm... Take a look for me. Which of these two is genuine? Don\\'t get nervous. If you say it\\'s real, it\\'s real.",
    "1924": "An original work? A mediocre person like me with neither talent nor principles can\\'t paint anything... But if it\\'s for you, I\\'m willing to devote my everything to painting you my heart.",
    "1925": "The painters want to make a living by painting, and the buyers want to purchase famous paintings. I\\'ve helped them realize their dreams. Why are you mad at me, Chief?",
    "1926": "\\\\\"Never give up on your dreams.\\\\\" Hahaha... That\\'s the funniest joke I\\'ve heard in Eastside.",
    "1927": "I used to be an art lover and a dreamer. As for now... Ha, I\\'m still passionate about art, but I don\\'t have a dream anymore. All I have is you, Chief!",
    "1928": "Got dragged into trouble by McQueen but still tried to help her and thanked her for spotting her talent... Haha, no one will care about such a fool even if they go missing.",
    "1929": "You\\'re the only valuable piece in my vault that cannot be replicated... Trust me, I\\'d never said that to anyone else before.",
    "1930": "What? Do you not find me attractive anymore?",
    "1931": "Why did you stop? You\\'re not interested in me anymore, Chief?",
    "1932": "What your eyes see may not be true. Instead of staring at me like this, why don\\'t you... verify it with your hands?",
    "1933": "Hmm... It\\'s about time to look for some new forgers.",
    "1934": "You asked me to come back so urgently. Worried I may dine with someone else?",
    "1935": "Stop giving me so much attention. What if... I get serious?",
    "1936": "You know I won\\'t turn down your request.",
    "1937": "Come, come closer.",
    "1938": "Got it.",
    "1939": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1940": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1941": "Yes?",
    "1942": "Ha",
    "1943": "Passing off fakes as the real thing? That\\'s just the basics of basics.",
    "1944": "Fret not, my lost lamb, you\\'ve only stumbled upon my hall of flames... Oh... The way out? You\\'ll have to distinguish... the real path from the false one.",
    "1945": "What treasure do you want me to bring you?",
    "1946": "Have you made up your mind? Will you become a follower of lies or a martyr for the truth?",
    "1947": "The only way to test if these flames are real is to touch them yourself. But if they are the fire of truth, a touch of it will burn you to ashes... It\\'ll break my heart to witness that.",
    "1948": "Fangs and claws? How can I bring myself to hurt you with those... I\\'ve got this mistletoe branch for you, though. Take it, will you?",
    "1949": "If you\\'d rather stay here forever, that\\'s fine too. I\\'ll keep you company eternally.",
    "1950": "Oh, are you praying for me to get you out? Pray harder then... The goddess may just pity you...",
    "1951": "Are you stepping into the fire and betting on your fate? Come on then, come to me. I\\'ll lead you to... the greatest ending!",
    "1952": "H-hi there... Minos Chief... Um, I... I\\'m the notorious cyclops of Eastside! ...No one would bully me if they hear this, right...?",
    "1953": "My power got stronger? ...Sigh.",
    "1954": "I\\'ll try my best... to accept this power, and become... someone who can control it.",
    "1955": "Sigh... If only there were no battles.",
    "1956": "A surprising victory...",
    "1957": "How... how scary... I-I\\'m really bad at fighting... I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry!",
    "1958": "Don\\'t look at me... Stay away from me!",
    "1959": "I don\\'t... want to... experience it again!",
    "1960": "Chief... I made some crafts today to give them to you. I hope you can be in a good mood all day...",
    "1961": "Chief... I made some crafts today to give them to you. I hope you can be in a good mood all day...",
    "1962": "Um... These are all... photos that I took before... but I\\'m not great at taking photos of people. Huh? You want to take photos, too, Chief? ...I-I will try my best!",
    "1963": "Ch-chief... That was from before, when I was really nervous... I couldn\\'t help but dig a hole in the room... I was thinking I could hide in it or something...",
    "1964": "Will Mommy and Daddy come to find me... I... I shouldn\\'t think about it. I\\'ll only cause them trouble...",
    "1965": "Um... These are all... photos that I took before... but I\\'m not great at taking photos of people. Huh? You want to take photos, too, Chief? ...I-I will try my best!",
    "1966": "Ch-chief... That was from before, when I was really nervous... I couldn\\'t help but dig a hole in the room... I was thinking I could hide in it or something...",
    "1967": "Will Mommy and Daddy come to find me... I... I shouldn\\'t think about it. I\\'ll only cause them trouble...",
    "1968": "Huh...? Are there Eastsiders here, too?... They won\\'t do anything out of line... right, Chief?",
    "1969": "It\\'s filthy inside the sewers... but also very safe. There, I won\\'t get chased by the FAC or bullied by others... That\\'s why... I just stayed there and didn\\'t come out...",
    "1970": "There\\'s a lot of weird people here, but... everyone treats me well! No one shuns me because of my background, and no one complains about my smell... Some are even eager to model for my photos. It\\'s really a novel experience...",
    "1971": "The world is so much clearer and prettier without my helmet... Thank you so much for giving me the courage to accept and control my power... I... I won\\'t run away anymore! But... can I rely on you a bit more? I\\'m still not that great at fighting...",
    "1972": "Hehe... I captured another amazing scene! Look, Chief... Ahh... Sorry... I\\'m a bit too excited...",
    "1973": "Hehe... I captured another amazing scene! Look, Chief... Ahh... Sorry... I\\'m a bit too excited...",
    "1974": "Hey... ahhh! That... that... helmet is very dirty...",
    "1975": "Ahhh! (Calms down) ...Oh, it\\'s Chief...",
    "1976": "Um... right! Please don\\'t... keep staring at me like that... It\\'s making me nervous...",
    "1977": "Um... right! Please don\\'t... keep staring at me like that... It\\'s making me nervous...",
    "1978": "It\\'s... not a dangerous mission, is it? ...No fighting involved, right?",
    "1979": "It\\'s... not a dangerous mission, is it? ...No fighting involved, right?",
    "1980": "Ah... Thank goodness everything turned out fine...",
    "1981": "Ah... Thank goodness everything turned out fine...",
    "1982": "I\\'m fine the way I am! I... I don\\'t need to get any stronger...",
    "1983": "I\\'m fine the way I am! I... I don\\'t need to get any stronger...",
    "1984": "11",
    "1985": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1986": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1987": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1988": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1989": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1990": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "1991": "My power got stronger? ...Sigh.",
    "1992": "Ah! Chief... I-I\\'m fine. I just... accidentally got entangled in the wires and fell down...",
    "1993": "Hehehe... I\\'m getting better at this.",
    "1994": "Chief, you... want to hear me play it right now? But... I\\'m not, not ready yet... P-please, can you wait for the official performance? I\\'m still not good enough... I need to practice more!",
    "1995": "Can I... really do well on stage? Back in school, I used to watch the bands shine on stage, and I always thought they were so cool... Do you think... I could be like that too?",
    "1996": "...My costumes for the performance are cute? Thank you! I made all the decorations myself by referring to comic books. I look quite like an idol in it, right? Hehehe ...",
    "1997": "This guitar case is so fluffy... I think... it fits me just right... It feels like cuddling... so comfy... Zzz...",
    "1998": "S-sorry! Could you please free me from this? ...Ah..! It\\'s getting tighter...",
    "1999": "Ahhh... Please don\\'t stare at me like that. I want to... wear my helmet again...",
    "2000": "Nice to meet you, Chief. I appreciate your consideration, but... no need to address me as Mrs. Braun... After all, that name is from the past. Please, call me Garofano.",
    "2001": "I will do my best to protect you.",
    "2002": "Now, you will never leave me again...",
    "2003": "Which delusional fool dares to touch my possession?",
    "2004": "Everything\\'s fine now. You\\'re still by my side.",
    "2005": "...No! I won\\'t lose a thing! No more!",
    "2006": "Don\\'t you dare!",
    "2007": "It\\'s fine. I can finally... be with you guys again...",
    "2008": "Is something bothering you? Whether it\\'s trouble at work or clothes that don\\'t fit... you can tell me, and we can sort it out together.",
    "2009": "Mmm, maybe I\\'m just used to taking care of people. I really enjoy being relied on... because in this way, no one would ever want to leave me.",
    "2010": "Ah, your cufflink fell off. Let me patch it up for you. Shh, don\\'t move... Relax. I\\'m a professional tailor. I won\\'t hurt you.",
    "2011": "Hmm? Why is your face so red? Am I choking you with the sewing tape? Please bear with me. This is the only way I can get your exact measurements... Didn\\'t you say you wanted a better-fitting shirt?",
    "2012": "You always give me a warm sense of familiarity. We\\'ve only known each other for a short while, yet it feels like a reunion with a long-parted family when I am around you... I haven\\'t felt this happy for so long.",
    "2013": "I\\'ve been through a lot of things, happy and sad. I cherish all those memories. But one can\\'t live forever in the past, right? That\\'s why... I\\'d rather cherish more what\\'s right in front of me.",
    "2014": "Buttons are very special accessories. They can sense human warmth and solidify emotions. That\\'s why I\\'ve kept my brother\\'s button close to my heart all these years... Would you like to see it?",
    "2015": "I just want to button you into my body and make you mine forever... Ah, sorry, I mean, will you be mine? I will cherish you, protect you, and never let you be taken away!",
    "2016": "You\\'re so adorable when you\\'re asleep... I just want to hold you in my arms forever, Chief...",
    "2017": "If you want to get closer to me, you can just tell me upfront. Don\\'t sneak up on me like that... I don\\'t want my needles to pierce you by accident.",
    "2018": "You want to have me too, right?",
    "2019": "Is there a door-to-door tailoring service request?",
    "2020": "Don\\'t worry. The order was completed smoothly.",
    "2021": "I will gladly accept everything you give me.",
    "2022": "All right, I\\'ll stay with you.",
    "2023": "Please be careful.",
    "2024": "Mmm, okay.",
    "2025": "Uh!",
    "2026": "Hmph.",
    "2027": "Yes?",
    "2028": "Gasps",
    "2029": "I will do my best to protect you.",
    "2030": "...MBCC? What\\'s that? You\\'re not tricking me into doing something bad, are you... I can continue my inventions here? Hurray! I can use your special equipment and rare materials, right?",
    "2031": "Thanks for the new saw blades. I\\'ve installed them around the engine to make a Chakram Mini Fan... Eh, this can actually be my new weapon...?",
    "2032": "Look, this little flying car is my proudest work, because I can ride it to see the blue sky and white clouds, that\\'s why I named it... the Formidable Tomato.",
    "2033": "Where did my Auto Dashing Wheel go... Eh? It\\'s already... dashed out...?",
    "2034": "Did you see how scary those guys look? They must be dangerous... Huh? I\\'ve chased them off already? Oh right...",
    "2035": "Next time I\\'ll bring the Electric Darting Mouse too. It would buy us more time...",
    "2036": "Little Landmine! Ready, go!",
    "2037": "The battery reserve... is running out...",
    "2038": "Chief, could you try out the Emergency Ejection Chair in your office? You\\'re gonna be fine. I\\'ve laid out some sponge mats outside.",
    "2039": "What\\'s in my bag? Uh... nothing special, really, just a couple of drills, hand saws, wrenches, pliers, and other tools... Oh yes, and a Foldable Auto Washing and Drying Machine.",
    "2040": "This Solar Spinning Top is a very interesting toy. You just place it on the ground, and it\\'ll keep spinning without any manual effort... Hmm? But whipping it is the fun part of playing it? Huh, is that so...?",
    "2041": "Alright... The disassembly of the cafeteria\\'s tables will be done soon. The next step is to move the training room\\'s gym equipment here for assembly. With these Gym Tables, everyone can eat and exercise at the same time, saving a lot of time and improving productivity...",
    "2042": "Little jellyfish, what are you doing here? Didn\\'t I tell you not to bounce around before the reinforcement is complete... Oh, Chief? This is not a weapon, just an alarm clock with bounce and chat features. In fact... Can I record your voice as its audio source? I think it\\'d be perfect...",
    "2043": "I replaced the movement of your broken watch and added in it a micro communication device that no scan can detect. Wear it and make a call gesture by your ear, and you can trigger the discreet call function. I... Uh... You always go on undercover missions, I think you, you may find it useful...",
    "2044": "My eye-opening journeys are the inspiration for many of my inventions, such as the Poisonous Mushroom Detector, the Wildlife-proof Tent, and the Convertible Camo Station Wagon... Speaking of, well, its passenger seat is still vacant... The seat\\'s color matches the shackles. It can massage your sore muscles and is even equipped with a small work desk. It\\'s also the perfect size for you!",
    "2045": "Lightning Escape Shoes, Auto Strikeback Shield, Nightmare Catcher Helmet... All equipped! This is the self-defense gear I took a long time to develop. Now they can finally serve their purpose! I\\'m certain they\\'ll give you the best protection. Also, t-thank you for accepting them.",
    "2046": "...Is something malfunctioning? Time to take it apart for a checkup...",
    "2047": "Hmm? What are these mysterious patterns on the lens?! Could it be some unknown optical phenomenon? I must analyze them carefully... Their shapes are... 100% identical to your fingerprints? Ah, so that\\'s just your fingerprints... Although I don\\'t quite understand why you always touch my spectacles, if that tickles your fancy, go on then...",
    "2048": "How strange... In theory, reversing the electrodes should solve it, but there\\'s no reaction... When did you come in? Have you been watching me doing experiments this whole time... Ah! I know! I\\'ve read about a theory that the presence of an observer can affect the experimental result. Keep staring and don\\'t move, let me try again...",
    "2049": "Hmm... I should take my new Tap Dancing Ice Cream Truck out for a test drive...",
    "2050": "Performance test of the Tap Dancing Ice Cream Truck complete. Um, the experimental data and user feedback suggest that I should replace tap dance with ballet...",
    "2051": "What other feature should I add?",
    "2052": "...? What are we about to do...?",
    "2053": "Ah?",
    "2054": "Oh, okay...",
    "2055": "(Grunts)",
    "2056": "(Bellows)",
    "2057": "Yes?",
    "2058": "(Grunts)",
    "2059": "Thanks for the new saw blades. I\\'ve installed them around the engine to make a Chakram Mini Fan... Eh, this can actually be my new weapon...?",
    "2060": "We didn\\'t fight tooth and nail to protect the Garden just to let it get ruined by you! How will you pay for this?!",
    "2061": "This way... I won\\'t be a burden to everyone anymore.",
    "2062": "I will protect the Garden!",
    "2063": "Yes, I heard you. No detours this time, I promise.",
    "2064": "This way, the Mentor will be proud of me too, right?",
    "2065": "I\\'ve disgraced the Garden again...",
    "2066": "Burn to ashes!",
    "2067": "Take me... back to the Garden...",
    "2068": "Are you here for the Mentor? ...For me? T-there\\'s nothing I can do for you. Well, I mean... If you don\\'t mind me messing up, I can try to help.",
    "2069": "Don\\'t think that just because you\\'ve earned the trust of the Mentor, we\\'ll all bow down to you! I\\'ll be watching you for any missteps!",
    "2070": "Hmph, so the Chief of the MBCC runs on just a sandwich for a whole day? One without lettuce, no less? Irregular meals and unbalanced nutrition... No wonder you\\'re all skin and bones... What are you tearing up for? I\\'m not worrying about you!",
    "2071": "The Mentor says no flower is born to be bent and trampled. But there are always people who ruin others\\' lives for their own despicable greed... They deserve to be burned in blazing fire.",
    "2072": "Remember to set off earlier next time you get a task on the shopping street. The claw machine? No, I\\'m not talking about that. It won\\'t be restocked anytime soon. What I mean is, you\\'re always looked down upon by those delinquents, so I suggest you put on some studded jackets. It\\'ll work, just trust me, it\\'s a tried-and-true method.",
    "2073": "You like the border of this page? My mom designed it. She said the journal was for the good memories only and all the bad things should be erased by the wind... After the Mentor left, everything I saw was gray and I thought I\\'d never journal again. Fortunately, she brought color back into my world... Yes, and you too. You also helped bring color back to my life, okay?",
    "2074": "Aren\\'t you tired of looking at your device and the documents all the time? Take some time to catch a breath. Don\\'t know what to do? Just go out for a walk. I do it all the time. Watch the swaying flowers and leaves, the bustling crowds, and the busy shops... That\\'s what life is all about.",
    "2075": "We\\'ve been looking for a safe place for the Garden to settle in. I just didn\\'t expect it to be here... Ahem! What I mean is, now that the whole Garden has moved here, I can extend my protection for the Garden and the Mentor to you. After all, the Mentor will be happy knowing you\\'re safe...",
    "2076": "Finally asleep... Both you and the Mentor are workaholics who never rest. At least pause to check on us... We\\'re all worrying about you...",
    "2077": "Huh? You want to pick a thorny flower? Then be prepared to pay with that hand!",
    "2078": "What are you staring at? Do I look like someone easy to mess with? Quit staring!",
    "2079": "Run errands? Sure. I was well trained for this in the Garden. You can count on me!",
    "2080": "Here\\'s what you asked for... Or... is it?",
    "2081": "Through a century of slashes, the blade\\'s purpose emerges.",
    "2082": "No need to come along, I can handle it.",
    "2083": "Get down!",
    "2084": "Got it.",
    "2085": "(Grunts)",
    "2086": "Hah!",
    "2087": "(Chuckles)",
    "2088": "Huh?",
    "2089": "This way... I won\\'t be a burden to everyone anymore.",
    "2090": "Oh my! Many police officers have chased Robber Rabbit, but you\\'re the only one who caught me!",
    "2091": "The next performance will be even more spectacular...",
    "2092": "The lights are set, and the stage is perfect! Are you ready? A spectacular phantom burglary is about to begin!",
    "2093": "Let me give you a spoiler: I\\'m going to run away in a bit! Better catch up to me!",
    "2094": "Taking back the notice! There was a great response to this mission, too!",
    "2095": "I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry... I shouldn\\'t have done that...",
    "2096": "Rob the rich and give to the poor!",
    "2097": "Can you forgive me now...",
    "2098": "Good morning! Good afternoon! Good evening! Hahaha, this means I want to see you all day!",
    "2099": "How trusting the Bureau must be to just put their precious Chief right here before me... Aren\\'t you afraid I\\'ll stuff you in a suitcase and run away?",
    "2100": "When night falls, the whole of DisCity becomes my stage!",
    "2101": "I am the righteous Robber Rabbit, robbing the rich to help the poor! I am not a thief! Don\\'t compare me to that kleptomaniac fox! Teaming up with her was just a coincidence.",
    "2102": "Well, I\\'m not doing this entirely out of righteousness... it\\'s more like belated atonement.",
    "2103": "Chief, you should really find some time to control that fox! It sucks for me to be her partner.",
    "2104": "I guess maybe I could just retire and retreat from my old business... After all, you\\'ll lead us to keep pursuing justice, right Chief?",
    "2105": "We will part someday, too. A free phantom robber won\\'t stay by anyone\\'s side forever... oh, are you sad? There there, I\\'m not leaving now. I\\'ll stay with you for a bit longer.",
    "2106": "The quality of this metal rod is pretty good... if you\\'re bored, how about I dance for you?",
    "2107": "Hehe, oh Chief, if you make trouble again, I will...",
    "2108": "A phantom robber could disappear at any time. Now you see me, now you don\\'t...",
    "2109": "If you let me out... will you be able to catch me again?",
    "2110": "Ugh, there\\'s nothing valuable there anyway...",
    "2111": "I can carry the whole world in my luggage!",
    "2112": "Oh? Is it my turn to shine?",
    "2113": "Ah!",
    "2114": "Okay!",
    "2115": "(Grunts)",
    "2116": "(Bellows)",
    "2117": "Huh?",
    "2118": "Eek!",
    "2119": "The next performance will be even more spectacular...",
    "2120": "Notice letter recovery... So, did you like the shower of petals I gave you?... Hehe, since you liked it, I\\'ll be keeping your heart...",
    "2121": "Heart-stealing mission accomplished...",
    "2122": "Shhh... Be quiet. You don\\'t want irrelevant people to come bother us, do you? Come. This rose is for you.",
    "2123": "This mask is part of the Phantom Robber\\'s identity. It should never be taken off lightly. But since you\\'ve seen my real face, I can\\'t let you off the hook...",
    "2124": "Cinderella\\'s not the only who fled the ball. There\\'s also the heart-stealing Phantom Robber, who left with a full bag of loot...",
    "2125": "I\\'m so bored... One petal... Two petals...",
    "2126": "Hey, stop moving around, will ya? You want to discover my flaws? Hmph... You\\'re just like that damn fox! Anyways, my costume is perfect...",
    "2127": "Don\\'t be shocked. I\\'m willing to get caught for a treasure I really want.",
    "2128": "You\\'re pretty lucky to have caught Roulecca! Wanna bet with Roulecca on something?",
    "2129": "Yay! Is today Roulecca\\'s lucky day too?",
    "2130": "Make a bigger bet. That\\'s still not enough... Let\\'s bet everyone\\'s life on it!",
    "2131": "Let\\'s go have some fun!",
    "2132": "Roulecca wants an even more thrilling game!",
    "2133": "Lost? Roulecca lost?! Hahaha!",
    "2134": "Hahahahaha!",
    "2135": "Finally... You\\'ve come to pick me up...",
    "2136": "It\\'s boring to be alone... Do you want to play a game with Roulecca?",
    "2137": "Roulecca\\'s heard a .45 bullet takes only 0.45 seconds to pass through the brain. Hmm... Who should Roulecca test it on?",
    "2138": "You know, Roulecca is a super famous assassin. Skills? Strategies? Intel? Come on. Only luckless suckers need those things. Once someone\\'s in Roulecca\\'s crosshairs, there\\'s no escaping their fate!",
    "2139": "Growing up, Roulecca has never lost at any games. Roulecca doesn\\'t need to cheat. Roulecca doesn\\'t need to work hard either. Everyone just dotes on Roulecca—all the time. Right? Because you do too, don\\'t you, Chief?",
    "2140": "Revenge is never Roulecca\\'s purpose. Hehe, in fact, it\\'s Roulecca\\'s reason for living.",
    "2141": "Bombs, enemies, Black Water, cult followers, even those deadly monsters, Roulecca is not afraid of them! I\\'ll dig out the truth behind everything.",
    "2142": "Don\\'t forget that Roulecca has placed a huge bet on you. You can\\'t lose your life to someone else so easily.",
    "2143": "Roulecca found another four-leaf clover! Hmm, with your terrible luck, Roulecca fears you\\'ll never spot one in your whole life. Alright... Take this one. In return, play with Roulecca for a bit more.",
    "2144": "Piapia, piapiapiapia!",
    "2145": "You seem bored. Do you want to play a game with Roulecca? Why don\\'t we—bet on this?",
    "2146": "Wow, have you come to play with Roulecca?",
    "2147": "Let\\'s go!",
    "2148": "Roulecca is back! Roulecca didn\\'t wander off this time.",
    "2149": "Eh? Roulecca can get even stronger?",
    "2150": "Stop ruffling my hair! I\\'m not a little kid! Waaa—cut it out!",
    "2151": "Hmm... How much should Roulecca aim to win this time?",
    "2152": "wooo",
    "2153": "Leave it to Roulecca!",
    "2154": "(Grunts)",
    "2155": "(Bellows)",
    "2156": "Eh?",
    "2157": "Huh?!",
    "2158": "Yay! Is today Roulecca\\'s lucky day too?",
    "2159": "Pew pew! Hehe, did I scare you, Chief? It\\'s just a water gun! Come and play with Roulecca!",
    "2160": "Roulecca is going to win more ice cream!",
    "2161": "Chief—Are you ready to gamble with Roulecca today? Whoever loses has to buy three melon popsicles!",
    "2162": "Roulecca loves to play on Eirene\\'s big ship. The people there won\\'t get angry even if I win a lot of things from them, and they always rush over to take pictures with me. They keep saying \\\\\"the god of gambling is alive\\\\\" and what not... I really don\\'t understand them.",
    "2163": "Lucky—I won so many cakes today! I\\'m so happy! However, many others also gave Roulecca dessert before, but... who were they? Hmm... darn, Roulecca can\\'t remember...",
    "2164": "Mmmm—what lovely weather! Chief, why don\\'t you come and play something with me? Surfing, beachball—you name it! Roulecca is down with anything!",
    "2165": "Haha... Chief, so itchy! Ahhh—Roulecca can\\'t lose!",
    "2166": "Chief... why do you keep staring at me? Is it because you like my shark doll, too? Hmph! This is Roulecca\\'s hard-won prize! I won\\'t lend it to you!",
    "2167": "Roulecca ate a strange cake this morning and turned into this. Um, Summer put it there on the table, I guess. It looked so delicious! I couldn\\'t help myself... Hehe...",
    "2168": "I feel like I\\'ve grown taller again!",
    "2169": "Hide-and-seek? No, thank you. Don\\'t assume I want to play such childish games just because Roulecca has become smaller, okay? Or, I have a better idea... How about I hide in your embrace?",
    "2170": "Aw... No snacks before bed? One bite, just one bite, okay? Roulecca is a lucky girl so I won\\'t get tooth decay! I assure you!",
    "2171": "Hmmm... Roulecca is tired. Chief, can you get Roulecca some teddy bears? I want to hug them as I fall asleep, like when I was little...",
    "2172": "If I had been as strong back then as I am now, I would have been able to defeat them all even with this gun.",
    "2173": "Do not treat Roulecca like a kid! Roulecca may be smaller now, but I am as clever as ever! Beating you will be easy as pie. Take that! Pew pew pew pew pew!",
    "2174": "Hehe, doesn\\'t this outfit look good on me, Chief? As one of my family, you should compliment me, too!",
    "2175": "...Who is it this time? Stop there, back off... I said <i>back off<\/i>!",
    "2176": "I\\'ve gotten stronger? ...Oi, you. What have you done to me!",
    "2177": "Rabbit, for you. You help me improve, and I bring you meat.",
    "2178": "Stay close, something\\'s up.",
    "2179": "Extra meat for dinner! We made a deal.",
    "2180": "That doesn\\'t count. One more round.",
    "2181": "Too late to run away, prey!",
    "2182": "Hmm...",
    "2183": "Ooh-eh? Ooh-eh-ee-ooh... Oh, it\\'s you. Nothing, I\\'m just chatting with Pippy.",
    "2184": "Never slip up in the Rust, or... there will be trouble.",
    "2185": "<i>Money<\/i>... Tell me what it is? Why does everyone want it?",
    "2186": "Pippy is not my pet. It\\'s my lunch. Too bad it\\'s too fat, too greasy to eat.",
    "2187": "Hey! What\\'s that thing? It\\'s... eating trash? I-it\\'s coming at me! A robot vac—what? M-make it go away!",
    "2188": "They used to call me a stray, one without a home. That\\'s not me anymore.",
    "2189": "I\\'ll go wherever you go. If you leave without me, I\\'ll go out and find you.",
    "2190": "You\\'re different from other humans. How... I can\\'t put it into words. It\\'s a hunch.",
    "2191": "Oi! Oi? You can doze off like that? ...Just like Pippy.",
    "2192": "What are you doing?! I\\'m not a dog!",
    "2193": "Why are you staring at me? What do you want!",
    "2194": "You... You\\'re not coming?",
    "2195": "Here, the stuff.",
    "2196": "Boring.",
    "2197": "If I win, extra meat for dinner.",
    "2198": "Hey!",
    "2199": "Okay.",
    "2200": "(Grunts)",
    "2201": "(Bellows)",
    "2202": "Hmm?",
    "2203": "Oh.",
    "2204": "I\\'ve gotten stronger? ...Oi, you. What have you done to me!",
    "2205": "I didn\\'t want to come... but Pippy loves it here. Emmm... Why do I need to change my clothes to play in the water?",
    "2206": "A water fight? I won\\'t lose.",
    "2207": "You want to play in the water, too? Here, take this horse with a horn. It can float.",
    "2208": "Oh-eh-ee-ooh-ee (Talking to Pippy)...Pippy says these colorful things look pretty.",
    "2209": "I\\'m not playing with it. I\\'m washing it clean! ...So that I can eat it later.",
    "2210": "Hmm... The water here is a lot better than the dirty Rust...",
    "2211": "Hey, quit splashing around! Water\\'s getting into my eyes!",
    "2212": "My pants got a bit wet, that\\'s all. Why are you staring at me?",
    "2213": "Isn\\'t this supposed to be a transfer? What\\'s the meaning of this? Sinner... detainment?! Chief, please clarify this! What have I done wrong?",
    "2214": "Thank you for the promotion. I\\'ll work even harder from now on.",
    "2215": "This may be the limit of my power right now. In any case, thank you for your trust and support.",
    "2216": "I will provide fire support for the team.",
    "2217": "The video recording is complete. It will be archived so you can review the gains and setbacks of this battle at your convenience.",
    "2218": "Keep shooting, cover Chief\\'s retreat!",
    "2219": "Suppressing fire!",
    "2220": "Hold the line... Don\\'t worry... about me...",
    "2221": "Hello, Chief. I\\'ve finished sorting out today\\'s files. Most are regular purchase requisitions and operation reports. You can just skim through them. There are also several classified files from the higher-ups, which I\\'ve singled out for you. You may need to address those at your earliest convenience.",
    "2222": "\\\\\"Don\\'t pass up any opportunity to prepare before things really start.\\\\\" This is what my mother taught me, and it helped me through many difficult situations.",
    "2223": "I\\'m humbled every time I see Ms. Nightingale work. You are indeed fortunate to have the support of such a reliable adjutant.",
    "2224": "\\\\\"The ten ring is only the limit for the target, not mine.\\\\\" I know, it\\'s a bold claim, umm... quite out of my usual character. But when it comes to shooting, I have that level of confidence.",
    "2225": "The Executive Committee does have many problems, such as management deficiencies and disorganized staff. It\\'s practically a miracle that it still functions... but I still learned a lot from it. I hope these experiences will help the MBCC\\'s work.",
    "2226": "A tidy work environment is good for physical and mental health. If possible, I hope you can clean your office regularly... I understand that you\\'re busy with work. You can ask me to do it.",
    "2227": "Please try to have a healthy schedule and rest on time. Leave what you can\\'t finish to your subordinates. Don\\'t push yourself too hard. After all... your health is critical to the proper functioning of the entire Bureau.",
    "2228": "When I faced those glamorous elites in the past, I doubted the worth of my own efforts. But not anymore. I don\\'t need to compare myself to them. Ms. Nightingale, Donald, and everyone at the MBCC made me realize it\\'s okay to just be myself. Thank you guys, and thank you Chief.",
    "2229": "Want some coffee? I ground the beans myself. The beans are from my home... I mean, from Eastside. It tastes wonderful and doesn\\'t have that bitter aftertaste. Are you sure you don\\'t want a cup?",
    "2230": "Please stop this behavior right now!",
    "2231": "Sinner Matilda, code MBCC-S-745, reporting for duty. Please issue your commands.",
    "2232": "The time required for the mission is estimated to be 8-24 hours, and I will keep you informed of the progress in real time.",
    "2233": "I will submit the mission report to the administrative office later. Please take a look.",
    "2234": "Stronger power entails heavier responsibility.",
    "2235": "Please don\\'t issue commands that may place you at risk. Regardless of the outcome, we must prioritize your personal safety.",
    "2236": "Danger!",
    "2237": "Got it!",
    "2238": "(Grunts)",
    "2239": "Ten ring!",
    "2240": "Yes?",
    "2241": "Ah!",
    "2242": "Thank you for the promotion. I\\'ll work even harder from now on.",
    "2243": "What exactly does your M... B... you know, that Bureau of yours do? Who are the people in it? Am I supposed to stay in there too? How long do I have to stay? Hmm... And what time is breakfast? What fun stuff is there?",
    "2244": "I\\'ve re-read the myth of the Sun Crow and I\\'ve discovered something new! Hear me out...",
    "2245": "When the last sun falls, the survival land will also be scarred... Uh... Did I say something just now?",
    "2246": "What\\'s that over there? It\\'s moving! Come on, let\\'s have a closer look!",
    "2247": "Where do you guys come from? Where will you go after I defeat you? Your weapons... Hey! I haven\\'t finished my questions, why are they running so fast?",
    "2248": "Sob... Why aren\\'t they afraid of my flaming slingshot!?",
    "2249": "Eternal flame, indestructible!",
    "2250": "I must find...",
    "2251": "Hey! Ha! ...Oh, I\\'m working out, would you like to join? I learned these moves from my neighbor back home. It\\'s great for your health, and it works wonders! My neighbor gramps does it every day, and I\\'ve never seen him sick!",
    "2252": "DisCity has many interesting legends, like how the cupcakes in Eastside are incredibly delicious... Could this also be a sacred sign? Yes, very likely, I must go check it out... But what should I bring? The address is clear, so I probably don\\'t need the compass? Then... a bowl? Napkins? A small spoon?",
    "2253": "Why does it rarely rain in DisCity? Why do you use Hypercubes as your currency? Why do you have so many documents to read every day? Why are your shackles red? Can they turn yellow, green, or purple? And why do you wear the same coat every day? Do you really only have one coat or do all your coats look exactly the same...?",
    "2254": "When the Sun Crow descends, the day will never end. The last drop of water will evaporate, and the vegetation will wither on the scorched earth... Huh? Why are you making that face? Oh, <i>They<\/i> must have spoken through me again. Hehe, you\\'ll get used to it, I wouldn\\'t be alive today without <i>Them<\/i>.",
    "2255": "My grandmother said that I am a chosen and blessed child, and pursuing the gods is my destiny... I really saw <i>Them<\/i>! <i>They<\/i> must be hiding somewhere in this vast world! If I can\\'t find <i>Them<\/i> today, I\\'ll keep looking for <i>Them<\/i> tomorrow; if I can\\'t find <i>Them<\/i> here, I\\'ll go somewhere else... I\\'ve got a whole life in front of me, I\\'m sure we\\'ll meet one day!",
    "2256": "Wait, wait, wait! Don\\'t rush off, how did you place your shoes when you went to bed last night? The toe facing out? Good... And which foot did you step out of the room with first? Right foot, hmm... And did your eyelid twitch? Left eye? Right eye? Neither twitched... Phew, what a relief! You can go out with peace of mind now, nothing will harm you today.",
    "2257": "At first, I thought everything here was different from my hometown, but after staying for a while, I found that everything seems the same. Like everyone in the Bureau, they\\'re all very nice people and care for each other like a family... And you! You\\'re the first DisFriend I\\'ve made, and I want to introduce you to my grandmother. She\\'ll be so happy!",
    "2258": "The ruins under the lake, the secret texts in the cave, and the bone that is said to grow one inch every year... And many more sacred signs my grandmother wrote in her notes, do you want to see them with me? Not everyone can see these things, just you and me! ...Hehe, I knew you couldn\\'t refuse! Let\\'s set off tomorrow. Ah wait, how about now!",
    "2259": "...Hehe, grandma\\'s beef soup is the best in the whole world... I... I want more...",
    "2260": "No, no, no! That\\'s not how you use the Dragon Seeking Ruler! You have to hold the handle, then think about what you want to find in your heart, and it will start to spin by itself... Huh? How was the mechanism designed? Uh... Design... Mechanism... Th-the mechanism is a secret! Yes, a secret! How can I casually tell you the tricks of the mysterious Eastern power!",
    "2261": "...Ha, I get it! You must want to have a staring contest with me, right! Hehe, bring it on, I\\'m really good at this. The first one to blink can\\'t ask questions for three days!",
    "2262": "Heaven and Earth, the vast universe. The compass turns, and the good luck returns! ...Ahem, the compass points to the North, it must be that way!",
    "2263": "Ah...? Is it time to go back already...? I haven\\'t had enough fun yet...",
    "2264": "Tell me more folklore about this place, myths, legends, whatever it may be, tell me more, tell me more!",
    "2265": "Oh! Are we going to beat up the bad guys? Surely I will give those baddies a taste of fire!",
    "2266": "Oh no! Run!",
    "2267": "Mmm!",
    "2268": "(Grunts)",
    "2269": "(Bellows)",
    "2270": "Huh?",
    "2271": "(Gasps)",
    "2272": "I\\'ve re-read the myth of the Sun Crow and I\\'ve discovered something new! Hear me out...",
    "2273": "My name is Victoria. Who are you? Where are you taking me? I... I can\\'t wander off too far. When Daddy comes back, he\\'ll be looking for me...",
    "2274": "My body feels warm... Is it because of your <i>love<\/i>, Chief?",
    "2275": "Cough... Such intensity is pushing my body\\'s limits.",
    "2276": "It\\'s been so long since I last breathed fresh air...",
    "2277": "Their faces were so peaceful.",
    "2278": "Blood... So much blood coming out of me... Daddy will be mad if he sees it...",
    "2279": "This will be your relief!",
    "2280": "Is it over...",
    "2281": "Have you come to visit me? I\\'m well today. I feel energized... Cough...",
    "2282": "Why does the bird in the bell jar want to break free so badly? Shouldn\\'t it feel more secure in a closed space? Only when you\\'re shielded from germs and danger can you always be free of worries, no?",
    "2283": "With just a slight squeeze, we can send these small bugs to the other side. Do you think they\\'ll meet Daddy there?",
    "2284": "White hair, white skin and white eyes, my looks frightened quite a few patients at SALVA. But I\\'m not a monster. My appearance is simply God\\'s blessings, as Daddy once told me.",
    "2285": "Seeing flowers wither, I find it hard to breathe, like something is stuck in my throat... Is this <i>sorrow<\/i>? Or, am I sick again?",
    "2286": "Friendship, company, strength, independence, love, life... These are all things you have taught me about, things I must treasure dearly.",
    "2287": "Do we really travel to another world in <i>death<\/i>? Or do we just dream a long, long dream? Perhaps... You and I are already in that dream.",
    "2288": "Many in the Bureau have left their parents, yet they\\'re not lonely. Is it because they have your company? Then... Can I also depend on you as they do?",
    "2289": "One little butterfly stops by the window One little rose withers in the garden Picture of the father torn into pieces Sitting alone by the bed",
    "2290": "Is this your <i>love<\/i> too? Hmm... I see. I\\'ll try to get used to it.",
    "2291": "Daddy used to stare at me like this too! Oh, the feeling of being loved makes me nostalgic...",
    "2292": "Can I... not go?",
    "2293": "(Gasps) The outside world is dangerous...",
    "2294": "Phew... I feel much better.",
    "2295": "Pierce through all of them and it\\'s done, right?",
    "2296": "Watch out!",
    "2297": "Okay.",
    "2298": "(Grunts)",
    "2299": "(Bellows)",
    "2300": "Eh?",
    "2301": "Ahhh!",
    "2302": "My body feels warm... Is it because of your <i>love<\/i>, Chief?",
    "2303": "Huh? ...Good morning, Chief. It\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen anyone come here... Will you stay with me in this beautiful sanctuary?",
    "2304": "Mmm... What a nice sunny day. I feel so warm and fuzzy.",
    "2305": "Chief, have a piece of candy. Once you eat it, all your discomfort and worries will disappear. Which color do you like? Red? White? Yellow? Green?",
    "2306": "Here, fold the paper into a square along this crease, then press the corners on both sides to the middle. Then finally, turn it over... and voila! A masterpiece is complete! You have to put the paper crane under the glass cover as soon you finish folding it, otherwise it\\'ll get hurt.",
    "2307": "Lonely? Why would I feel lonely? I live in a beautiful and safe glass house with storybooks, candies, dolls, paper cranes, and... lots and lots of love. They shield me from all danger. I\\'m the happiest little bird in the world.",
    "2308": "One paper crane, two paper cranes... Zzz... Zzz...",
    "2309": "What are you going to do, Chief...? I don\\'t want to leave my room.",
    "2310": "When the sun shines upon the glass and paper cranes, radiant rays of light will shimmer in all directions... Those are the colors of happiness... Chief, you must love it, too!",
    "2311": "You\\'re a \\\\\"human\\\\\"... as recorded in our inherited memories, aren\\'t you? You look... even frailer and wearier than me. Do you long to sleep in my \\\\\"cocoon\\\\\" as well?",
    "2312": "Wonderful, even more flowers than last time...",
    "2313": "Shh... Keep it down, they\\'re all asleep, waiting to wake up to a beautiful, sweet world. Would you... like to join them?",
    "2314": "Do you find my halo cute too? Hmm... Although I don\\'t really know what it is, its color matches my \\\\\"cocoon,\\\\\" and it lights up when I sing... I\\'ll demonstrate it for you. I\\'m sure you\\'ll like it.",
    "2315": "I\\'ve been here ever since I was hatched, following the teachings of our inherited memories and singing for those who sleep here. I sing and sing, until beautiful flowers bloom... Lonely? Sad? Empty? Why would I feel that? This is my destined mission... Don\\'t humans have their own mission? Oh, what a pity.",
    "2316": "Before you, these flowers were the only colors here. Picky as they are, they will never give up the vulgar, messy mortal world for the eternal slumber here if they don\\'t like the songs... You smell just like them... If my singing pleases you, more flowers will bloom, right?",
    "2317": "You want to help me fix my bandages? Yes, please, I\\'d appreciate it... These wounds? They‘ve been with me since my hatching. They... are the prints of my defect... the marks of my kind‘s endeavor to save me, and the proof that I was loved...",
    "2318": "My cocoon is the toughest, most perfect shelter that keeps all dangers out... As long as I see it protecting me overhead, I feel comforted and secure...",
    "2319": "Soiled souls on the earth, smiling flowers in the cocoon, fret not for the pain, may this song put you to rest...",
    "2320": "Does a human\\'s gaze always feel so searing...? Even when I close my eyes to sing, I can still feel its warmth and weight... How amazing...",
    "2321": "An arsonist stands before you. Put me behind bars if you can.",
    "2322": "My flames burn ever brighter.",
    "2323": "I won\\'t lose to it again. From now on, I shall command the flames.",
    "2324": "As long as I can protect those who I love...",
    "2325": "But everything has been burned clean.",
    "2326": "No... no... I\\'ve lost control...!",
    "2327": "Taste the wrath of fire!",
    "2328": "The flames... devoured everything after all...",
    "2329": "Did you... come here just to see me? Um... did you bring some crème brûlée?",
    "2330": "Whoa! Do you... do you know what happened to my attackers?",
    "2331": "Stay away from me! I won\\'t pay your medical fees if you get burned.",
    "2332": "My hair looks weird, doesn\\'t it? It looks like it\\'s on fire... Many fear me because of it, but they don\\'t know what flames really look like.",
    "2333": "I won\\'t randomly combust! Don\\'t try it anymore!",
    "2334": "I hope that everyone I love can be happy and safe... why are you looking at me like that? If you\\'d like, I\\'ll add you to that category.",
    "2335": "After fighting side by side with you for so long, I can now believe that this power can bring happiness to others...",
    "2336": "Someday, when this is all over, I want to make crème brûlée again with my own two hands... will you be the first to give it a taste?",
    "2337": "Is the bakery we passed by earlier about to release new products...?",
    "2338": "Are you treating me like a log? Drilling wood for fire?",
    "2339": "No need to watch me like that. My hair makes me stick out enough already. I won\\'t run away.",
    "2340": "You want some info about food?",
    "2341": "I included a food review. Ahem, I just made it.",
    "2342": "Be careful, or the fire will go wild again.",
    "2343": "You don\\'t have to worry here.",
    "2344": "Sigh!",
    "2345": "Yep.",
    "2346": "(Grunts)",
    "2347": "(Bellows)",
    "2348": "Hmm?",
    "2349": "Eek!",
    "2350": "My flames burn ever brighter.",
    "2351": "Is everyone excited about staying up on New Year\\'s Eve? Ahem... Honestly, I\\'m not that excited. I just happen to be wearing clothes I don\\'t usually wear!",
    "2352": "Ah! ...Didn\\'t you say you wanted to see fireworks? I just set some off for you.",
    "2353": "Gotta try some new things in the new year. I... I\\'ve invited you over because I want you to try... the new flavor of my pudding.",
    "2354": "Wah... You... Forget it! It\\'s a happy day today. I\\'ll let it slide.",
    "2355": "I... It\\'s been a while, and I\\'ve made progress! The Bureau\\'s kitchen is in perfect shape! Even the fire alarm... hasn\\'t been triggered...",
    "2356": "I recreated braised meatballs, mapo tofu, and dumplings all with pudding! You must finish each and everyone of them!",
    "2357": "My mum used to braid my hair when I was little. I think this looks quite festive. What do you think? Does it look good?",
    "2358": "The lady in the library once told me a traditional tale. In the story, the queen has a fan that makes flames covering a whole mountain... I wonder if mine works like that too...?",
    "2359": "\\\\\"Springtime lethargy\\\\\" is quite common... But hey, don\\'t start on the first day of the new year! ...Anyway. If you\\'re sleepy, j-just find a spot and take a nap here.",
    "2360": "Why are you staring at me? Just say it if you don\\'t like this outfit! So I didn\\'t have to... What do you mean you love it?! Hump... You really are...",
    "2361": "Uh, you must do it like this! Keep stirring as you say your wish out loud... D-don\\'t worry, I won\\'t tell anyone about your wish. I\\'ll guard it as our little secret.",
    "2362": "The bigger the fire, the more likely the wish will come true!",
    "2363": "We made this Christmas pudding together. No... no matter how the taste turns out, you\\'ll finish it, right?",
    "2364": "Every year around this time, Mom and Dad would deck the kitchen with these kinds of decorations. I tried to recreate what the holidays felt like at my home... What do you think?",
    "2365": "What... what are you standing around for? The Sinner who gave me the recipe said that stirring the batter and making wishes together is the most important step! I... I\\'m only reminding you because you\\'re clearly going to mess it up, hmph!",
    "2366": "Mmph... The presentation is perfect. The sweetness is just right. The texture is well-balanced too. Miss Faye didn\\'t trick me with substandard stuff this time... But both types of dried fruit are so delicious, which one should I use... Eh?! Where did the rest go?!",
    "2367": "This Christmas sweater feels good to the touch, doesn\\'t it? So soft and warm. It reminds me of the sweaters Mom used to knit for me when I was little. They were heavy and unfashionable, but every time I wore them I felt like my mom was giving me a big hug.",
    "2368": "You keep staring at my hair accessory. Are you craving gingerbread? It just so happens that I\\'ve written a bakery review rating their gingerbread. Check it out if you want... You think it\\'s cute? W-well, your taste is not that bad then.",
    "2369": "Are you with those creepy perverts? You better watch out or I\\'ll... Oh, I\\'m sorry, that was Ray... Did I... Did I do something weird again?",
    "2370": "I hope my acting skills will level up too, so that one day I can play a role that touches people!",
    "2371": "Awesome, let\\'s go kill some more scumbags together!",
    "2372": "New job? Alright, let\\'s give our best!",
    "2373": "Phew! Did we do well this time, Chief?",
    "2374": "No worries, failure is my old friend...",
    "2375": "Back off! Don\\'t come close!",
    "2376": "In the end... I can\\'t become...",
    "2377": "Have you gotten some rest today? Cramming too much work into your schedule takes a toll on your health.",
    "2378": "Sometimes, I\\'ll go ballistic out of the blue, and become so aggressive like I\\'m a different person. That\\'s because there\\'s another girl inside me, she\\'s... Are you laughing, Chief? I\\'m serious! I\\'m not a good enough actress to fool you like that!",
    "2379": "I\\'m warning you, keep your distance from me, got it? I\\'m not Luvia. Don\\'t you get close to me.",
    "2380": "Voilà! This is the look I\\'ve specifically designed for casting! So... if you were the casting director, would you give me a part?",
    "2381": "I want to create a hero who protects the weak and stops darkness. I want... to be somebody\\'s light too. Hehe, I\\'m only getting small parts now, but I\\'ll keep trying.",
    "2382": "I used to think of Ray as a burden, but then I realized, she was in fact my guardian angel! Hehe, to be honest, I like Ray a lot... Shh! We mustn\\'t let her hear it, or she\\'ll call me an idiot again!",
    "2383": "...Hey, it\\'s Ray. What are you running from? I\\'m not here to shock you. Ahem... Because of you, Luvia... has changed a lot. Thanks... I\\'ve just come to say that.",
    "2384": "Hey you, listen up! In fact, we both... l-like you a lot! Hehe! Can you guess which of us that was?",
    "2385": "Ray, listen to me. I\\'ll be sure to protect myself this time. Trust me, okay? Oh come on, don\\'t be mad, pretty please!",
    "2386": "Um... Chief... Please stop... Please don\\'t... Ah!",
    "2387": "Wanna join us? Of course, I\\'m glad to have someone to talk to. Actually, Ray is pleased too. She\\'s just too shy to let you know!",
    "2388": "Yay, I can make it to the new series\\' casting too! Love you, Chief!",
    "2389": "Sigh, I failed at the casting again. But I did finish the task you gave me!",
    "2390": "Whoa! You hear that? That\\'s quite dangerous!",
    "2391": "Oh... Stop it, Chief... You\\'re messing up my hair...",
    "2392": "Hehe, Luvia Ray is here to conquer you!",
    "2393": "Be careful!",
    "2394": "Sure!",
    "2395": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2396": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2397": "Hmm?",
    "2398": "Ah!",
    "2399": "I hope my acting skills will level up too, so that one day I can play a role that touches people!",
    "2400": "\\\\\"Luvia Ray, the symbol of happiness on a snowy night, makes her grand appearance. Remember to hang your stocking by your bed! Otherwise, you won\\'t get any presents...\\\\\"",
    "2401": "Ha-ppy holi-days! Hmm... My body language in front of the camera needs more work...",
    "2402": "Chief, the holiday-themed studio is super well-equipped, isn\\'t it? Ah... Careful! If you damage the equipment... the Bureau\\'s budget will be at risk.",
    "2403": "Sigh... I honestly don\\'t get what\\'s so nice about this outfit. It\\'s so hard to move around in this... Change it? No way. I\\'m gonna respect Luvia\\'s decision.",
    "2404": "This is a cool role! Working hard discreetly to be a guardian of others\\' wishes... I\\'ve made up my mind! I\\'ll come back here to shoot more films next year! But next time we\\'ll be playing the main role!",
    "2405": "♪Chief, can you stay with me for a bit longer? I want to enjoy tonight\\'s view with you!",
    "2406": "Luvia said don\\'t just shake hands with anyone in studios. But if it\\'s you... it\\'s fine.",
    "2407": "Eh, Chief! Quit staring at me, watch the movie! I know, I know, I only played a supporting role... but I gave a mind-blowing performance during the shooting!",
    "2408": "I\\'ve been waiting for you all this time.",
    "2409": "As long as you need me, I\\'ll always stay by your side.",
    "2410": "Everything that\\'s mine will also be yours. This is the purpose of Hecate.",
    "2411": "Stay behind me.",
    "2412": "Now, what\\'s next?",
    "2413": "I\\'m fine, I don\\'t feel any pain.",
    "2414": "You... mustn\\'t be too close to the Chief!",
    "2415": "It\\'s okay... There will still be another me.",
    "2416": "Did you sleep well last night, Chief? Today\\'s order, please.",
    "2417": "...All is well as long as you\\'re safe, no?",
    "2418": "How are Sinners different from Corruptors? After all, we all live, bleed, and die. What makes you think we\\'re any different?",
    "2419": "If I\\'m gone, there will still be another Hecate. You shouldn\\'t worry.",
    "2420": "You can be stricter with me. Those who are kind to me... always end up...",
    "2421": "Ever since meeting you, I\\'ve always felt like I\\'m no longer Hecate. I don\\'t know what I\\'ll become. When that day comes... will you guide me?",
    "2422": "If one day... I no longer exist as Hecate, will you still keep me by your side, Chief?",
    "2423": "I don\\'t need any more orders, Chief. Whatever journey awaits us ahead, I\\'ll follow my heart and walk with you till the end.",
    "2424": "Sweet dreams.",
    "2425": "If it embarrasses you to say the order out loud, don\\'t hesitate to just use me.",
    "2426": "You don\\'t have to do this. I\\'ll always stay by your side.",
    "2427": "Is this an order? Okay, I\\'ll see to it.",
    "2428": "It\\'s done. I\\'m home.",
    "2429": "If this is what you wish for, I\\'ll do it.",
    "2430": "I\\'m here.",
    "2431": "Be careful.",
    "2432": "Okay.",
    "2433": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2434": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2435": "I don\\'t understand.",
    "2436": "...Okay.",
    "2437": "As long as you need me, I\\'ll always stay by your side.",
    "2438": "Well, if you didn\\'t request it... I wouldn\\'t have had the chance to wear this outfit.",
    "2439": "I don\\'t slack off even during breaks.",
    "2440": "What do I need to do today?",
    "2441": "My hat? They say only painters would wear it. By the way... what\\'s a painter?",
    "2442": "People always take pictures of me when I wear this outfit, but it\\'s been a long time since anyone has asked me to put it on.",
    "2443": "If there\\'s a chance... would you please take me somewhere outside the battlefield?",
    "2444": "I used to listen to bedtime stories on the phone. But one day, I forgot what the story was about, then the phone never rang again.",
    "2445": "Adjutant Nightingale said my sketchbook was very dangerous and shouldn\\'t be seen by anyone, so I hid it in this box.",
    "2446": "I have painted some paintings related to you, Chief. They all said I must not let you see them.",
    "2447": "If you like this style... Do you want to make it the Bureau\\'s uniform?",
    "2448": "Hi, I\\'m an otherworld mage with the power to manipulate dreams and fantasies... These are my lines, right?",
    "2449": "Magic value increased.",
    "2450": "Are you going to join us too, Chief? All right, I will do my best to protect you, even if it\\'s just a game.",
    "2451": "Mess told me that this is the gear only a mage gets to have... The bigger the hat, the higher the bonus stats. Want one too, Chief?",
    "2452": "It\\'s nice to do something other than following orders once in a while... I guess this is what relaxing means.",
    "2453": "In the virtual world, anyone can become the character of their dreams, and do things that they can\\'t do in reality... I guess this is what makes games so alluring.",
    "2454": "Nightmare also put on the new gear, it seems to like it a lot.",
    "2455": "Mulangrador... Ah... EMP says that to really immerse yourself in the game, you should say the magic skill names out loud.",
    "2456": "O brave warrior who have come here from afar, accept the guidance of the heavens and stars to embark on a quest for the secret treasure...",
    "2457": "Where do you want to go for the mission, Chief? Just give me the order and I\\'ll come with you.",
    "2458": "I, I don\\'t know what a Sinner is... Sob, all of you gang up on one little kid!",
    "2459": "Rewards are only for good kids, right?",
    "2460": "Who do you want to turn into a doll, Chief? I can do it for you!",
    "2461": "Please protect me, Chief!",
    "2462": "Eh—All I did was just wave my hand. Why have they stopped moving?",
    "2463": "Wow—they are so incredible. They even dare to resist my control.",
    "2464": "Dolls, be good!",
    "2465": "Strange... I can\\'t feel my body...",
    "2466": "Ma\\'am! Ma\\'am! Ma\\'am! You like me calling you that, don\\'t you?!",
    "2467": "The wounds... w-were from falling over accidentally! Everyone at the Bureau h-has been very nice to me...",
    "2468": "Don\\'t listen to them. I\\'m so cute and well-behaved. Of course I won\\'t bully others.",
    "2469": "Ma\\'am... They don\\'t let me go out on my own to play... J-jailbreak? What\\'s that? I don\\'t understand.",
    "2470": "I\\'m so jealous of \\\\\"The Homeless\\\\\" in Syndicate. They manage to live in such a dangerous place on their own, unlike me, who can do nothing without Chief!",
    "2471": "Look! Isn\\'t this doll as cute as me? But... its heart has been slit open by the baddies. I can\\'t fix it no matter how hard I try... Can you help me, Chief?",
    "2472": "Will we never be separated if you have been turned into a doll... Hmm? I\\'m not lying this time!",
    "2473": "If a kid has done lots and lots of bad things, but he has repented, will you hate him, Chief? ...I don\\'t want to be hated, especially by you.",
    "2474": "Some other idiots said I\\'m not a \\\\\"good boy.\\\\\" What should I do... Well, let me go sort them out while Chief is away!",
    "2475": "Are you looking for trouble?! ...Hahaha, gotcha! I was just pulling your leg. Didn\\'t I do a great job?",
    "2476": "Why are you staring at me like this, Chief?",
    "2477": "Shouldn\\'t I leave this kind of manual work to adults? I just want to stay with you, Chief.",
    "2478": "I worked sooo hard for you, Chief. Are you not gonna praise me?",
    "2479": "I knew you\\'d like me best, Chief!",
    "2480": "For you... I will gather the courage to enter the battlefield!",
    "2481": "Sob... I\\'m so scared.",
    "2482": "Okie-dokie!",
    "2483": "Ahhh!",
    "2484": "(Bellows)",
    "2485": "Eh?",
    "2486": "Ah!",
    "2487": "Rewards are only for good kids, right?",
    "2488": "I\\'ve seen it all, your vulnerability, your weariness, your sadness... Come here, come to me, let me share your burden and pain, let me be a loyal companion to you...",
    "2489": "Do not turn a blind eye to your own needs. Do not turn your back on your savior. A faithful \\\\\"seafarer\\\\\" shall attain the precious pearls they long for.",
    "2490": "What do you see in the center of the vortex?",
    "2491": "Come here, step into my trap.",
    "2492": "Thou, my enemy, shall forever be trapped under the billow and never see the sunlight anew.",
    "2493": "Tch, my tricks didn\\'t work this time.",
    "2494": "Be trapped here forever!",
    "2495": "I can\\'t die here... I\\'ve got to, got to live...",
    "2496": "Are you here to look for the answers to your questions? ...Why are you being so cautious? I don\\'t bite.",
    "2497": "Have you heard of an old deep-sea civilization far, far away, where the roofs of the houses are made of shells, and the walls of pearls? That\\'s where I come from.",
    "2498": "Be quiet, and don\\'t turn on the light. Only tranquil darkness can calm my soul.",
    "2499": "My appearance? Heh, I know what you\\'re getting at. Strange, grotesque, terrifying... Are these the words you\\'re looking for? I\\'m a monster, after all... What? I have a unique beauty? Me? This is the first time anyone\\'s ever said that about me. Do you, um, really think so?",
    "2500": "Detested, like I used to be, by those who thought of me as a monster, or worshiped, like I am now, by the seafarers... It makes no difference to me, for I don\\'t care what they think of me. But I do care... what I look like to you.",
    "2501": "This beautiful little thing is, in fact, a ferocious predator. It ate all the fish that once shared this tank. Ferocious as it is, it is forever trapped behind this thin wall of glass. It must be longing for freedom too...",
    "2502": "Sometimes, beautiful, harmless-looking things can be extremely dangerous. Most people don\\'t realize that until it\\'s too late. Ah, is there anything more exciting than seeing the fear on a horror-stricken face at the moment of truth?",
    "2503": "I construct traps from lies and illusions, and lay them all around me to ensnare whoever gets near. Sincerity is a commodity that is of no use to me. But why? Why the waters parted and the thorn thicket made way for you to come through and see behind the walls that I\\'ve erected around me?",
    "2504": "I\\'m a bit tired. I think I\\'ll have a bath...",
    "2505": "You want to know what happened to those eager souls who came to me for help? What do you think happened to them? Of course I gave them what they wanted and made them live happily ever after.",
    "2506": "Yeah, you\\'re getting the hang of it now... Don\\'t devert your eyes. Can you feel yourself being enveloped by the waves? Okay, let them wash away your pain, bring you serenity, cleanse you of all your sins.",
    "2507": "Good, let us commiserate with more lost souls.",
    "2508": "Hmm, more seafarers have received the blessing.",
    "2509": "The more you offer, the more you will receive. Now, show me how sincere you are.",
    "2510": "Whatever wishes you have, you can tell me.",
    "2511": "Watch out!",
    "2512": "Okay.",
    "2513": "(Grunts)",
    "2514": "(Grunts)",
    "2515": "Yes?",
    "2516": "(Gasps)",
    "2517": "Do not turn a blind eye to your own needs. Do not turn your back on your savior. A faithful \\\\\"seafarer\\\\\" shall attain the precious pearls they long for.",
    "2518": "I\\'m a free musician, a star of the streets! The genius saxophonist who never forgets a note... Echo, at your service! Now, aren\\'t you excited to hear me play a tune after that introduction?",
    "2519": "A mere few pages of sheet music are no challenge to me at all!",
    "2520": "The saxophone genius is about to give the most spectacular performance! You won\\'t want to miss it!",
    "2521": "This invigorating march will be the opening theme of our battle!",
    "2522": "That marks the end of Echo\\'s perfect performance, thank you!",
    "2523": "Oops, I messed up the notes...",
    "2524": "Listen to this wonderful, miraculous melody!",
    "2525": "It\\'s so cold... so dark...",
    "2526": "Hey you, sleepyhead. Should I play a tune to wake you up?",
    "2527": "Outfit, perfect. Stage, perfect. Saxophone, perfect! Okay, I\\'m ready to... Hey, don\\'t touch my carefully arranged props! The ambiance matters to buskers too!",
    "2528": "Hmm, hmm... Oh, I\\'m thinking of a new song! I once read a quote that says art is inspired by life. It\\'s spot on! I\\'m immediately filled with inspiration after eating!",
    "2529": "Slacking off? Of course not! I\\'ve memorized all those materials! Don\\'t believe it? Quiz me then, I owe you one if I fail! If that\\'s not enough, I can even recite the entire menu of the cafeteria for the past three weeks!",
    "2530": "Well, I\\'m sure people just haven\\'t noticed me yet. It happens to all the geniuses! I just know that as long as I keep playing, everyone will fall in love with my music one day!",
    "2531": "Feeling down? Let me sing a song for you! Back in the orphanage, everyone loved my singing! Whenever I sang, people would laugh so happily! I wonder if my singing voice brings joy to others?",
    "2532": "I hope my performances can touch many, many people! Being watched, admired, and remembered... means I\\'d never be forgotten or feel lonely again! Just thinking about it makes me so happy!",
    "2533": "Don\\'t tell anyone, but even a genius like me gets nervous when performing... But as soon as I feel your gaze from the audience, all my anxiety is gone, and my body is filled with strength! Because I know there\\'s someone who\\'ll always support me... Thank you, my number one fan!",
    "2534": "Wow~ This place is really cozy, much warmer than the underpass! Let me try out this mattress!",
    "2535": "Hey, hands off my Kute! ...Yeah, so what if I\\'ve named my saxophone? It\\'s my precious friend!",
    "2536": "Okay, okay, I know what you want! Here you go. Keep it safe though, the genius saxophonist\\'s autograph is priceless!",
    "2537": "Busking? That\\'s my bread and butter! I\\'ve got this!",
    "2538": "Weird... Why are the other buskers all shoving money at me and begging me to leave... Hmm, I must be too good at the saxophone!",
    "2539": "Is there more? I want more~",
    "2540": "Come! Let me show you what a true saxophone genius sounds like!",
    "2541": "Wahhh!",
    "2542": "Alrighty!",
    "2543": "Mmph!",
    "2544": "Ah!",
    "2545": "Huh?",
    "2546": "Ahhhhhhh...",
    "2547": "A mere few pages of sheet music are no challenge to me at all!",
    "2548": "I came crawling back after doing so many wrong things... Chief, please don\\'t tell my father. I can\\'t bring more shame to my family.",
    "2549": "I don\\'t want anyone else to get hurt.",
    "2550": "This way, I can help alleviate more people\\'s suffering. Sorry... you must have been waiting for a long time.",
    "2551": "Don\\'t let go of my hand.",
    "2552": "Thank you everyone for your hard work!",
    "2553": "I\\'m sorry, it\\'s all my fault... I messed things up for everyone...",
    "2554": "This is my resolution!",
    "2555": "I still... can\\'t do anything...",
    "2556": "Chief, you look tired. Want me to help you relax? I know a thing or two about relieving pressure.",
    "2557": "Why does everyone keep staring at my clothes? This is the most basic gown my family owns...",
    "2558": "I\\'m sorry, Chief... As a Sinner, I don\\'t have any special combat skills, but I hope I can help others with my healing power. Even... even if I can help just a little bit.",
    "2559": "I\\'m a member of the Spencer family... but don\\'t call me something pretentious like \\\\\"my lady\\\\\"... Call me Ariel.",
    "2560": "Chief... do you have any older siblings? It\\'s exhausting to try to live up to talented siblings. Sometimes... I feel that it\\'s hopeless no matter how hard I try...",
    "2561": "Oh Corruptors... your bodies are rotting constantly, so you must feel a lot of pain. Your disfigurement and pain is worsening... I\\'m sorry, I will definitely try to become stronger to save you.",
    "2562": "Please don\\'t stay up too late, it\\'s not good for your health. Let me help you finish this work! Sigh... are you staying up late because I suck at my job? I\\'m sorry! It\\'s all my fault!",
    "2563": "Please don\\'t venture off too far from me on our next mission... If we get split up again, we\\'ll become the laughing stock.",
    "2564": "What can I do to help? Sigh... no! I cannot give up. I know I can succeed!",
    "2565": "Chief... if I did anything wrong, please tell me directly... please... please don\\'t be like this...",
    "2566": "Huh? ... Chief, why are you staring at me like this? ... Did I do something wrong?",
    "2567": "I will succeed this time!",
    "2568": "I hope I didn\\'t embarrass the Spencer family...?",
    "2569": "I hope I can become an asset to you.",
    "2570": "Hmm? Chief... your hand is a bit cold.",
    "2571": "I don\\'t like to fight, but I don\\'t like to flee either.",
    "2572": "Watch out!",
    "2573": "I will try my best!",
    "2574": "(Grunts)",
    "2575": "(Bellows)",
    "2576": "Yes?",
    "2577": "Ah!",
    "2578": "I don\\'t want anyone else to get hurt.",
    "2579": "Can I really take this dress? Thank you, Chief. In return for your kindness... let me play a song for you.",
    "2580": "I hope you like my performance.",
    "2581": "You look tired. Would you like to listen to some soothing music on the piano?",
    "2582": "Aw... I can\\'t concentrate... like this...",
    "2583": "Music... expresses a wide gamut of emotions. Well... I wonder if you felt my emotions, Chief?",
    "2584": "I can\\'t help feeling a little nervous when I think about playing the piano in front of you...",
    "2585": "Chief... If you don\\'t mind, will you play a duet with me?",
    "2586": "I often forget to release the right pedal when I\\'m nervous... Sorry, did it sound terrible?",
    "2587": "Hmm... Which song should I practice today... Would the Chief like this one?",
    "2588": "Oh? Do you want to hear something else...? Phew—I\\'m glad I have prepared other songs as well.",
    "2589": "Lush green gardens, grand golden halls, and... cramped rooms. (Sigh) This is the Spencer house, a place I can never leave.",
    "2590": "It seems... I can see further out.",
    "2591": "My mood always gets a lot better every time I see these flowers in my room.",
    "2592": "I\\'ve always wondered... if I\\'d run away from home and hid in where they have to search for one whole day, then, would they... care about me a little more?",
    "2593": "I\\'ve heard... that anyone or anything that got tainted with Mania will become the most evil beings in the world... But, they didn\\'t become like that voluntarily, did they? They must be in pain too... If only I could help them...",
    "2594": "(Sigh) My big brothers and sisters are all so outstanding. I wish I could be like them...",
    "2595": "How much longer will this monotonous life continue?",
    "2596": "At tomorrow\\'s ball, I must bring out the best in me and do the Spencer family proud! Oh, I almost forgot to get my dress ready.",
    "2597": "How brave of you to face me up close and personal... What if I hypnotize you again, Chief?",
    "2598": "Can\\'t wait to fall into a deeper dream, can you?",
    "2599": "I never knew such wonders existed beyond the bounds of knowledge...",
    "2600": "Now, whose pain will I uncover here?",
    "2601": "The process was enjoyable.",
    "2602": "Occasional failures are essential for a balanced mind.",
    "2603": "Release... your power!",
    "2604": "This is the ending... I deserve...",
    "2605": "Hello, Dear Chief. If you have something on your mind, feel free to chat with me. How much do I charge? Oh, money is not what I want from you.",
    "2606": "Consciousness is a prison, and every one serves a life sentence in it. In the face of it, your Bureau is but a toy jail.",
    "2607": "Why psychology? Well, because it\\'s an elegant, graceful science. I don\\'t need any scalpels to kill you... I\\'m just kidding, don\\'t be so tense.",
    "2608": "Tick, tock, tick, tock... Life is like the pendulum of a clock, constantly swinging between pain and weariness.",
    "2609": "Every night, quite a few Sinners are plagued by nightmares. I\\'d like to talk to them, <i>individually and privately<\/i>. I hope you won\\'t mind?",
    "2610": "The beast deep in our consciousness will be roused one day. When the time comes, will you be able to subdue it, or will you get devoured by it, till there\\'s nothing left of you? I look forward to finding out.",
    "2611": "The so-called mercy from others is like a flock of vultures. When an atrocity happens, they circle above your head, screeching and squeaking. Only when the victim stops struggling will they land, and scavenge for the last bits of bloody flesh.",
    "2612": "The most stubborn patient and the most ruthless psychologist—don\\'t we make the perfect pair?",
    "2613": "Look at the pocket watch. Relax, relax. You\\'ll begin to feel sleepy... and sleepier... Tell me, what did you see in your dreams?",
    "2614": "I know what you\\'re thinking about... No subconscious impulses go unnoticed before my eyes.",
    "2615": "Oh, here comes the patient I\\'ve been expecting. Shall we begin?",
    "2616": "This is not the job of a psychologist... Sigh.",
    "2617": "I\\'ve seen some interesting things on the way. Wanna hear my stories?",
    "2618": "Look, the abyss is even closer now...",
    "2619": "Danger!",
    "2620": "That\\'s right... You\\'re the strongest Sinners.",
    "2621": "I will.",
    "2622": "(Grunts)",
    "2623": "(Bellows)",
    "2624": "Hmm?",
    "2625": "Yes?",
    "2626": "Can\\'t wait to fall into a deeper dream, can you?",
    "2627": "\\\\\"Knowledge,\\\\\" \\\\\"greed,\\\\\" \\\\\"love\\\\\"... Seduced by them, you have finally come to see me.",
    "2628": "Man is driven by desire, and desire is inherently boundless.",
    "2629": "I can answer all your questions, but one <i>answer<\/i> begets another... tell me, who are <i>you<\/i>?",
    "2630": "You won\\'t be able to see the answer clearly at such a distance. Come closer...",
    "2631": "To use the sun and moon gods as totem decorations... is this piety or arrogance? Human nature is interesting precisely because of its contradictions, is it not?",
    "2632": "Don\\'t rush to wake up. We are the only ones in the Temple of Dreams.",
    "2633": "What, do I have the answer you want hidden on me? If it can really help you, please feel free to explore...",
    "2634": "\\\\\"Know thyself\\\\\"—a seemingly simple riddle, yet it has stumped generations of brave warriors, and now... it\\'s finally your turn.",
    "2635": "You followed the guidance of dreams to my realm. Are you here to break the shackles in your heart?",
    "2636": "Ah, what a wonderful dream.",
    "2637": "The cruelty of the real world always catches people off guard, so why not stay here and wallow in this beautiful moment with me?",
    "2638": "Some say life is a dream, because everything emerges and perishes on a term that mortals have no control over. One day, you might wake up and realize that the life you\\'ve lived through was just a doze on a sunny afternoon.",
    "2639": "What you see with your eyes may not necessarily be the truth.",
    "2640": "Tell me, is it more unfortunate to never wake up from a dream or to never dream?",
    "2641": "Here, I can take you back to the past and make up for those unforgettable regrets... Will you abandon yourself to the dream eternally?",
    "2642": "Want your dream to come true instantly? It\\'s simple, just stop the time at the moment you make your wish to me, and make it flow again when your dream is achieved. Brilliant, isn\\'t it?",
    "2643": "People are obsessed with interpreting dreams. They always try to recreate their dreams in reality, even the unpleasant ones...",
    "2644": "Dreams express the deepest desires in a person\\'s heart. Let\\'s see, what do you desire?",
    "2645": "Seems like it\\'s up to you to take care of things from now on... I just don\\'t know if the patients of SALVA Hospital will take their meds on time without me?",
    "2646": "Wouldn\\'t that person be scared to see what I look like now?",
    "2647": "If I had such powers back then, perhaps I could have eased their pain...",
    "2648": "Are you ready? Let\\'s go then.",
    "2649": "Thank goodness you\\'re okay. I didn\\'t do anything special. The credit belongs to everyone.",
    "2650": "Don\\'t be discouraged. It\\'s not your fault. You did a great job.",
    "2651": "Time to take a shot...",
    "2652": "You must... live on...",
    "2653": "Chief, let me know if you need help. Don\\'t be shy with me.",
    "2654": "As head nurse, listening is also one of my responsibilities. If you don\\'t mind, I\\'d be happy to share your burdens.",
    "2655": "Everyone loves your smile, Chief, so please do it often! Believe me, your smile is adorable.",
    "2656": "Dr. Iron can be scary sometimes. However... I can promise you that she\\'s not a bad person. She must have her reasons for doing things.",
    "2657": "Children are adorable. Pure, innocent and carefree... Just like Chief! Gives one the urge to protect them.",
    "2658": "Victoria always asks me, \\\\\"Anne, aren\\'t you tired from smiling all the time?\\\\\" Be careful, Chief. That kid is surprisingly sharp. Don\\'t get stumped by her like me.",
    "2659": "Can Syndrome Mania really be cured? I\\'m not sure. But even if there\\'s only a sliver of hope, I won\\'t give up. This is a long, uphill battle. Will you join me?",
    "2660": "You can always rely on me. I\\'m always ready to help you, on patients\\' affairs or otherwise.",
    "2661": "You fell asleep here... work must\\'ve been exhausting yesterday! Thank you for your hard work, Chief...",
    "2662": "Chief, no! I\\'m going to be upset.",
    "2663": "What is it? Does looking at me this way make you happy? Alright then. I\\'ll let you look a bit longer.",
    "2664": "Please help me look after the injured in the Bureau.",
    "2665": "Sorry for making you wait so long. Did they take their meds on time while I was away?",
    "2666": "Thank you for your help.",
    "2667": "Don\\'t worry. I won\\'t let anything happen to you.",
    "2668": "Watch out!",
    "2669": "Okay.",
    "2670": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2671": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2672": "Hmm?",
    "2673": "Ah?!",
    "2674": "Wouldn\\'t that person be scared to see what I look like now?",
    "2675": "Sorry, my room is a bit messy. I didn\\'t have time to clean it up... I\\'m the one who got caught off guard. Why are you blushing?",
    "2676": "A hot bath does wonders for relieving fatigue...",
    "2677": "Sure enough, my tummy feels hungry after a hot bath. Mmm... I can already smell the delicious dumplings. Want to stay and have some with me?",
    "2678": "No matter how hard the work, it\\'s worth it to win them more chances to live... Besides, whenever I come back here, I can wash away all the fatigue and get a good rest.",
    "2679": "Hmm? Are you worried that I was too busy to eat? Hehe... Don\\'t worry, I can take good care of myself. You\\'re the one I\\'m worried about, Chief. Did you eat and sleep well when I was away?",
    "2680": "I feel a bit sleepy.",
    "2681": "You want to brush my hair? Then please be careful. Don\\'t pull on it and hurt me.",
    "2682": "You like my smell? Maybe it\\'s the rose oil. It\\'s great for relaxing the mind and relieving fatigue... Hehe, are you feeling sleepy, too? Is that why you keep looking at me?",
    "2683": "According to the legislation, I cannot resist your arrest, but I want you to know that you can never trap me if I want to leave.",
    "2684": "Well, would you like to have a little chat with me now?",
    "2685": "Thank you for sending me into the depths of hell.",
    "2686": "Don\\'t let me find your legal loophole.",
    "2687": "Listen to your lawyer, and I will help you win it all.",
    "2688": "How much money does it take to change your mind?",
    "2689": "Do as I say.",
    "2690": "This is the judgment... I deserve.",
    "2691": "When there is a lawyer, there is strife. Only you can cope so well with having a lawyer as the first person you see each day.",
    "2692": "The scale is the symbol of law, and I can tip it in your favor.",
    "2693": "Mr. Fox? I like the name. It\\'s one of the smartest animals.",
    "2694": "Everyone is born with the right to pursue justice with whatever method is employed.",
    "2695": "When gold coins are piled in front of people, many will trade their souls for it... and I gain justice from it.",
    "2696": "I am capable of getting you to do anything for me... but I can\\'t bring myself to.",
    "2697": "If someone destroys the tender flower buds, they deserve hell no matter who it is, right?",
    "2698": "One day, you will bring punishment upon me, and I shall submit and accept it all.",
    "2699": "As it happens, I have a few more files I need to read through. I\\'ll grab a coffee with you later.",
    "2700": "I have represented and won 38 cases of physical harassment, and you should know this, right?",
    "2701": "I thought I would never get to experience this... feeling of special attention here.",
    "2702": "I charge by the hour for working outside the office. It doesn\\'t include additional fees such as consulting fees.",
    "2703": "Job done. The bill will be sent to your email later. Please remember to pay on time.",
    "2704": "Well, if you want to know whether I\\'m more eloquent, you can find out yourself.",
    "2705": "The war without gunfire is the war of words.",
    "2706": "Keep an eye on your surroundings.",
    "2707": "Okay.",
    "2708": "Ugh!",
    "2709": "Humph!",
    "2710": "Oh?",
    "2711": "...",
    "2712": "Well, would you like to have a little chat with me now?",
    "2713": "My dear friend, congratulations on crossing the twilight zone, and welcome to my palace.",
    "2714": "Let\\'s hear what you think.",
    "2715": "I offer you my goodwill, my dear friend, but... don\\'t take it too seriously",
    "2716": "Pleasing poems and sweet serenades gush forth from my mouth and turn into sharp crescents.",
    "2717": "I control all fairness, justice, metrology, and poetry in this world... Do you... wish to subvert me?",
    "2718": "Don\\'t worry. There\\'s still time for you to find a way to pry the victory from my hands.",
    "2719": "This is not the way to light a fire...",
    "2720": "Can you get the answer you want by just staring at me?",
    "2721": "Welcome! Only 100,000 DisCoins for a song by me! I can play it from dawn to dusk—what a steal, eh? How about it, boss? Want to order one?",
    "2722": "No matter how much I practice, I only know how to play this one song.",
    "2723": "Money, life, and death are all up to fate. On second thought, they can be up to me!",
    "2724": "That\\'s a lot of people. By the way, I charge per person for my show.",
    "2725": "How was it? The song\\'s not bad, eh?",
    "2726": "Woah, woah, you could just tell me to stop. There\\'s no need to get violent.",
    "2727": "Reincarnation is the endless cycle of life!",
    "2728": "Don\\'t be afraid... I\\'ll leave... without a fuss.",
    "2729": "Look who I bumped into! My my, it\\'s my lucky day!",
    "2730": "If someone in our line of work doesn\\'t believe in reincarnation, they\\'d lose their job.",
    "2731": "It\\'s music, not noise!",
    "2732": "Oak Casket\\'s box sure smells good! You can sleep deep and sound in it without a worry!",
    "2733": "Passing away is nothing to be scared of. I will guide you to where you need to be. Then, we shall meet again.",
    "2734": "To rise from the ashes, one must first burn to cinders. As long as you endure the searing pain, you shall be granted rebirth.",
    "2735": "Maybe it was you who guided me across the Lethe?",
    "2736": "I believe in reincarnation, but there are many things in life that one cannot take away after death. Will you still remember me after reincarnating...? No worries. Even if you forget, I will do everything possible to meet you again and make you remember me forever!",
    "2737": "I\\'m so bored. How about I play a song to cheer you up, boss?",
    "2738": "It\\'s broad daylight! I\\'ll scream if you do this! Unless you pay for the emotional trauma!",
    "2739": "I know I\\'m cute, but don\\'t look at me like that... are you in the mood for another show?",
    "2740": "Let me see, am I working for heaven? Or just playing for mortals?",
    "2741": "Sigh, I didn\\'t make much this time, but I\\'ll give you a share!",
    "2742": "Not bad, not bad. Care to tip a bit more?",
    "2743": "Think I\\'m just a random passerby? I\\'ll send you off to the afterworld!",
    "2744": "Whoa!",
    "2745": "Alrighty!",
    "2746": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2747": "Du-du-du!",
    "2748": "What\\'s that?",
    "2749": "Oh lawdy lawdy!",
    "2750": "No matter how much I practice, I only know how to play this one song.",
    "2751": "Come one, come all! Feast your eyes on the performance of this great musician! Just trying to make a living here! Your kind support will be appreciated!",
    "2752": "Hehe, thanks boss! Thank you so much! May you be blessed with fame and fortune!",
    "2753": "Thanks for watching! If you enjoyed the performance, please show some support! DisCoins, Hypercubes—any currency is welcome! I also take digital payment! Whatever\\'s convenient for you!",
    "2754": "Hey there, you little brat! Aren\\'t you afraid of karma? Put it back, you hear me? Tsk, people have no morals anymore. The world has really gone to the dogs...",
    "2755": "...Huh? My erhu performance sounds like sawing wood? Nonsense! You\\'re just too uncultured to appreciate the erhu classics I\\'m playing... Why is this stupid stereo jammed again? I spent a fortune on it at the second-hand shop!",
    "2756": "...Hmm? No one\\'s around right now. Lemme take a break...",
    "2757": "Ahem, boss, mind your manners. Don\\'t get all handsy. I\\'m a proper artist.",
    "2758": "Boss, you\\'ve been staring at me for a long time. Why, you wanna have a duet with me? ...Come come, don\\'t be shy. You take the erhu, I\\'ll play the suona...",
    "2759": "(Yawns) Good... morning... I\\'m... Letta Devonshire, the link between dream and reality... Hmm... (Rubs eye) If there are no other questions, I\\'m gonna sit down...",
    "2760": "Hmm... Now I can go to many more interesting places...",
    "2761": "Hehe, I\\'m not the innocent lady you think I am, dear Chief.",
    "2762": "Deep inside the fog... What will I find in there?",
    "2763": "Hehe... What a wonderful adventure.",
    "2764": "Oh... I feel dizzy... I must get out of this dangerous place now...",
    "2765": "Shine into... this endless fog!",
    "2766": "I want to... go home...",
    "2767": "Hmm... (Stretches her back) I hope you\\'ll have... an amazing day... Hehe...",
    "2768": "Sorry, I sleepwalk a lot... Please wake me up at once if you find me doing anything weird, promise me!",
    "2769": "Um... Bedroom... My bedroom... Hmm, yes, found it... (Wakes up) Ah! This, this is your bedroom? Sorry, I hope I didn\\'t disturb you.",
    "2770": "What\\'s in these bottles... Vegetables? Huh? Are you sure they\\'re not spoiled? Then why is this color so... Ehh?! Some Sinners survive on this near the end of the month? What... What an interesting food...",
    "2771": "When can I... become a grown-up? Not controlled by anyone... I can just do whatever I want to do...",
    "2772": "You\\'ve already... found out? That I pretend to sleepwalk? I knew I couldn\\'t fool you... But you\\'ve known it for a while, right? Hehe, that makes us partners in crime.",
    "2773": "When I\\'m with you, I can feel real, uninhibited freedom and happiness... So, it\\'s decided! You must take me with you on your next adventure in Eastside!",
    "2774": "Been here, been there too... Now, where should we explore next? Hehe, no matter where we go, even if it\\'s a place I\\'ve already been to, I\\'m sure I\\'ll have the most exciting experience with you around! ...You\\'ve still got work? Hmm... Alright, I can wait! After all... we\\'ve still got the whole night!",
    "2775": "I can\\'t eat them all... Hehe...",
    "2776": "Ow... Ow... Stop making biscuits on me, little kitty...",
    "2777": "Shh... Care to look for some fun in the foggy DisCity with me tonight?",
    "2778": "Hmm... See you later. No need to worry about me... I won\\'t get lost.",
    "2779": "Hehe... As always, it was a fun trip to an interesting place.",
    "2780": "The light has gotten warmer...",
    "2781": "It\\'s getting foggy! Let me see... Where should I go have fun today?",
    "2782": "...I sense danger.",
    "2783": "...Hmm.",
    "2784": "(Grunts)",
    "2785": "(Bellows)",
    "2786": "Hehe...",
    "2787": "(Gasps)",
    "2788": "Hmm... Now I can go to many more interesting places...",
    "2789": "I can smell many interesting \\\\\"scents\\\\\" around here. Hmm... Maybe I can make a few really extraordinary perfumes out of them.",
    "2790": "I smell a richer aroma...",
    "2791": "I love to capture all fragrances, and then... keep them forever.",
    "2792": "The smell here is... suffocating.",
    "2793": "The scent lasted quite a while this time.",
    "2794": "I despise the stench of blood...",
    "2795": "Indulge in this fragrance forever!",
    "2796": "The scent... has dispersed...",
    "2797": "Whenever my restless emotions are soothed, I know... it\\'s because you have come to me...",
    "2798": "Grey amber, iris root... these are all excellent ingredients, but they don\\'t meet my standards. They always have a lingering, unpleasant odor... I need something more pure, more vivid...",
    "2799": "There must be a never-fading \\\\\"immortal fragrance\\\\\" in this world. It\\'s just that I haven\\'t found the right ingredients to create it yet...",
    "2800": "Naturally, rich perfumes must be stored in exquisite glass bottles. They need to be delicate, transparent, and sealed so that not a whiff leaks out... I\\'ve collected many, and there must be one that\\'s good to put you in.",
    "2801": "Only fragrances made from life can completely mask the scent of decay. Perhaps it\\'s the complexity of the soul and memory that brings a more layered aroma... Humans are truly fascinating.",
    "2802": "I like to handle the ingredients myself. When I strip away those ivory-colored chunks and feel the warm fluids flow through my fingers, inspiration for the fragrance will gush incessantly into my mind... Oh, how I love this feeling.",
    "2803": "Typically, beauty is a notable characteristic of top-tier ingredients, hence I love approaching beautiful bodies. However, sometimes I find unexpected delights with other characteristics, like you... You have a fragrance that drives one mad.",
    "2804": "I already know what kind of perfume I will make you into... Something light, clear, and with a soft warmth... topped with a sharp finish. Such a special fragrance will surely dispel all nightmares and fears. If I could keep your scent on me forever, then perhaps my heart could achieve complete tranquility.",
    "2805": "Moments of leisure and comfort... are best to enjoy a hint of fresh green notes.",
    "2806": "Do you like the perfume I have on today, too?",
    "2807": "Hmm, you look so intoxicated... What does this scent make you think of?",
    "2808": "Just don\\'t make me go to any... foul-smelling places.",
    "2809": "If I told you I brought some \\\\\"perfume ingredients\\\\\" back, would you help me carry them?",
    "2810": "Hmm, this should be considered a masterpiece.",
    "2811": "Would you like a fragrance tailored just for you?",
    "2812": "Careful not to bump into things.",
    "2813": "Got it.",
    "2814": "Uh!",
    "2815": "Hmph.",
    "2816": "Yes?",
    "2817": "Oh...!",
    "2818": "Ah... I smell a richer aroma...",
    "2819": "I haven\\'t done anything bad in the past two years. If you arrest me now, you better have a valid reason, or else... I still have six orders to settle, are you going to pay for them?",
    "2820": "You put so much effort into me... what dangerous work do you have for me this time?",
    "2821": "I can wipe out those guys without Bai Yi\\'s help now.",
    "2822": "Hey, don\\'t run around! If something bad happens, I can\\'t save you.",
    "2823": "Hmph! Weaker than a common Syndicate thug.",
    "2824": "Don\\'t just stand there! Run!",
    "2825": "Is that all you got?",
    "2826": "Ha... didn\\'t expect this kind of death...",
    "2827": "When did you get here? Why are you still standing around? Aren\\'t you tired? Find a place to sit...",
    "2828": "These sticks belonged to someone I knew many years ago. He died on the side of the road and I collected his corpse. Afterwards, these sticks came into my possession.",
    "2829": "Am I stingy? If I didn\\'t intervene, those jerks would\\'ve spent all the money in the account on booze...",
    "2830": "Back at Whitestone, I was once tasked with finding a cat. The Syndicate was huge, and I spent a week trying to find it. When I finally returned the cat, the owner thought I was a thug and chased me away. I was pretty hurt, to tell you the truth.",
    "2831": "Back at Whitestone, I got up at four o\\'clock in the morning every day. Over here it\\'s more relaxed.",
    "2832": "Before, I lived in fear every day: fear of starving, fear of getting stabbed in the back, fear of dying... but ever since I met them, nothing seems to scare me anymore...",
    "2833": "I know they hide some things from me, but I don\\'t care. I\\'m happy with just living a stable life with them.",
    "2834": "I was thinking, maybe Whitestone Industries can move to your place. After all, you don\\'t restrict our freedom too much, and you\\'re reliable... at least more reliable than those two.",
    "2835": "... I\\'ve nothing to do. I wonder what Bai Yi and Che are up to. Ooh... bet they\\'re not up to any proper business either.",
    "2836": "You... you\\'re a big bully!",
    "2837": "Why did you find me? Got something for me to do? ...Well, if you\\'re just visiting then do as you please.",
    "2838": "Okay, I\\'ll do it. Any special requests?",
    "2839": "Done! I\\'m going to bed now.",
    "2840": "Hmm, this isn\\'t bad either.",
    "2841": "Time for some exercise.",
    "2842": "Hey!",
    "2843": "Got it.",
    "2844": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2845": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "2846": "Hmm?",
    "2847": "Ah...",
    "2848": "You put so much effort into me... what dangerous work do you have for me this time?",
    "2849": "Umm... Bai Yi is, uh... busy, so I\\'m here to fill in for her. Don\\'t stare at me like that. I know I look weird in this outfit... You think I look nice? Well, thank you.",
    "2850": "This pastry is quite yummy. Want some?",
    "2851": "Stop looking. The contact hasn\\'t come yet. Sigh, it\\'s so not worth it to sacrifice this much for just one order...",
    "2852": "Is this tea rare and expensive? Too bad I can\\'t tell the difference. If only Che were here. He\\'d know something about it.",
    "2853": "Don\\'t worry about Bai Yi. She just has an upset stomach from eating leftovers. It happens all the time. Don\\'t mind her.",
    "2854": "A fruit bowl? No thanks, I\\'ll just have some tea. It\\'s free? Oh, leave it here then.",
    "2855": "Are you off your rocker? If you keep this up, I\\'m quitting!",
    "2856": "Emm... All I have to do is sit here and wait for that person to come, right? All right, then. I\\'ll let you know when he\\'s here.",
    "2857": "M...B...CC... is that right? I\\'ve heard of your place! There are a lot of Sinners there. Enough chitchat, let me in!",
    "2858": "Ah... strength is like collecting garbage. The more you collect, you stronger you become.",
    "2859": "Yes. As expected, it\\'s better to be stronger. The earlier I get off work, the better I sleep.",
    "2860": "I bet I can find a lot of treasures on this trip.",
    "2861": "What\\'s that thing called... from the book... oh right! Hardness triumphs over softness, strength over feebleness!",
    "2862": "Run! They\\'re catching up!",
    "2863": "Stop!",
    "2864": "You are not allowed to go there...",
    "2865": "Where are we going today to scavenge... no, I mean, to catch Sinners?",
    "2866": "The people from the procurement office always spend money like crazy. I\\'ll have to give them a talking to. Money doesn\\'t grow on trees, you know.",
    "2867": "Want to come play DisChess? They\\'re not here, so let\\'s just play with the two of us. Chief, don\\'t go! Try it out! It\\'s fun!",
    "2868": "\\\\\"Don\\'t treat others\\' gossip as gifts, because you\\'re not a garbage collector.\\\\\" Huh? Is this line in the book making fun of me, Chief? No? Good, I\\'ll write it down then.",
    "2869": "Slaying Corruptors is my job, but enjoying life is more important.",
    "2870": "Chief, did you stay up late again? You can\\'t keep doing that! Young people need their sleep.",
    "2871": "Compared to where I used to live, this place is too fancy! I\\'d rather sleep in the hallway and give my bed to the kids from the Syndicate.",
    "2872": "Chief, since we\\'re so close already, I\\'ll cut to the chase—when will the balcony I applied for be approved?",
    "2873": "When can we go to the Rust together again? There\\'s a new shipment over there. I hear there are some light track construction materials. If we scavenge some, we can make a fortune!",
    "2874": "Oh yeah! Right there! Harder! Wow... feels so good...",
    "2875": "Huh? I\\'m the only one left standing here? No! That\\'s so boring!",
    "2876": "Chief, the weather is so nice today! Won\\'t you come along?",
    "2877": "Harvest time! I can\\'t fit everything in my cart!",
    "2878": "Huh? This hammer seems lighter!",
    "2879": "Measly Corruptors, come at me!",
    "2880": "Danger!",
    "2881": "No problem",
    "2882": "(Grunts)",
    "2883": "(Bellows)",
    "2884": "Hmm?",
    "2885": "Oh my God!",
    "2886": "Ah... strength is like collecting garbage. The more you collect, you stronger you become.",
    "2887": "This is da Syndicate gangsta rapper. Who are you, lookin\\' dumb as loser? This way of life, betta play it cooler, or I\\'ll take away all your moola...",
    "2888": "An inspiration for a new song!",
    "2889": "Now this is fit for a star!",
    "2890": "Keep up with my rhythm!",
    "2891": "You want to defeat me? Dream on!",
    "2892": "Rippp—there are bound to be some mistakes in improvisation.",
    "2893": "Drop the beat!",
    "2894": "This isn\\'t hip hop at all...",
    "2895": "Oh, you\\'re here? Get me a glass of water. I\\'ve been writing songs all day and now I\\'m dying of thirst.",
    "2896": "I still prefer to have a gold chain. It\\'s easier to sell during an emergency, and you can even throw it in someone\\'s face during a fight... I really don\\'t know why my colleagues prefer diamonds.",
    "2897": "When will you give me a complete audio mixer? Right now I only have this broken tape recorder. So humiliating for a rap superstar like me!",
    "2898": "I hate people who wear sunglasses indoors. Which serious rapper would do that to look cool?",
    "2899": "Those Eastside f*ckers disgust me. All those contract lawyers, those regulations - they just don\\'t want to pay. I beat the boss\\'s face to a pulp afterwards. It was awesome, hahaha.",
    "2900": "Write a song just to diss an idiot? That would be too boring. Only your name, Chief, deserves to appear in my work.",
    "2901": "Let\\'s create a new label and call it \\\\\"MBCC\\\\\"! I\\'ll be the founder and you can be my first signed artist! Don\\'t tell me you can\\'t! It\\'s easy, I\\'ll show you.",
    "2902": "I always thought that everyone outside of the Syndicate was a good-for-nothing, but you... you\\'re the first person who wasn\\'t born in the Syndicate that I can talk to. Come chill with me more often. I\\'ll cover for you.",
    "2903": "Rap isn\\'t about flaunting wealth, so don\\'t try too hard. Red-hot lyrics and loops are all there is to it. Inspiration is like a waterfall, the battle is not lost, and the sewers are your only way out.",
    "2904": "Where the **** are you putting your hand? Got a death wish?",
    "2905": "Want to hear me rap? Why else would you come... unless you\\'re daydreaming that I\\'d work for you?",
    "2906": "You want a superstar like me to run errands? Are you drunk out of your wits?",
    "2907": "Done! Aren\\'t I amazing?",
    "2908": "The rhyme is smoother now.",
    "2909": "The word \\\\\"fail\\\\\" doesn\\'t exist in my dictionary.",
    "2910": "Be careful!",
    "2911": "Got it.",
    "2912": "(Grunts)",
    "2913": "(Bellows)",
    "2914": "What?",
    "2915": "Wow!",
    "2916": "An inspiration for a new song!",
    "2917": "Help! Let me go! A beauty is being kidnapped!",
    "2918": "I think I\\'ve gotten better at fighting.",
    "2919": "I think I\\'m invincible.",
    "2920": "Gogogo!",
    "2921": "Whew! Victory at last.",
    "2922": "Sigh, I can still...",
    "2923": "It\\'s not over yet!",
    "2924": "That hurts...",
    "2925": "Chief... can you give the infinitely adorable Hella some pocket money? Oh my gosh, Chief is the best!",
    "2926": "What is it, Chief? Uh... your wallet? Hehe, here, take it back, I was just practicing...",
    "2927": "Me? Pretending to be cute? Who said that?! Am I not cute?",
    "2928": "Don\\'t bring up all that crap from the past with me. I\\'m not some little girl who cries all day and needs to be comforted. I survived this long thanks to my friggin\\' self.",
    "2929": "The weight, size, and feel of this pipe is as if it\\'s custom-made for me, so don\\'t ever ask me to switch weapons. I will never abandon it!",
    "2930": "I\\'ll take you to hang out with Ninety-Nine when we get the chance. Even though she looks scary, she\\'s actually quite nice.",
    "2931": "I actually don\\'t like to fight. Even though the chance of dying is small, it\\'s still painful and troublesome... Don\\'t worry, I\\'m still happy to do things for you. No need to feel guilty.",
    "2932": "I\\'ve decided, since you stick to me all day long and are impossible to get rid of, I will graciously accept you as my underling. Just don\\'t ever betray me, okay?",
    "2933": "I\\'m so sleepy... come here, let me lean on you for a nap...",
    "2934": "Are you giving me a massage?",
    "2935": "Ha, I knew you\\'d come find me! Miss me so soon?",
    "2936": "Finally, it\\'s my turn to go! Chief, can you give me some more money?",
    "2937": "Mission accomplished. Any rewards for me, Chief?",
    "2938": "Yay!",
    "2939": "Hmm? You really like being with me, don\\'t you?",
    "2940": "Watch out.",
    "2941": "Got it!",
    "2942": "(Grunts)",
    "2943": "(Bellows)",
    "2944": "Eh?",
    "2945": "Oh f-",
    "2946": "I think I\\'ve gotten better at fighting.",
    "2947": "Who the hell is interrupting my nap time again? Kneel at once! Eh... If it\\'s not Chief? (Giggles) Awesome! Now my croquet match can go as scheduled!",
    "2948": "Ah! What\\'s with these little animals? They\\'ve been giving me trouble the whole day! You\\'re lucky you guys are cute, or I would have...",
    "2949": "Don\\'t bring me white flowers. I prefer red roses. If it happens again, I\\'ll... hit your head a hundred times!",
    "2950": "The weight, size, and texture of this scepter, and its shiny luster... It\\'s as if it was tailored for me! And... most importantly, it\\'s got a big head! So big and beautifully awesome!",
    "2951": "I want to eat that thing that\\'s a dough topped with lots of fruit and cream! What\\'s it called... some kind of tart...? Right, right! A fruit tart! I want it! Make one for me now!",
    "2952": "It\\'s almost tea party time! Go and decorate the venue now, Chief... Why? Because you\\'re the only idle servant here with nothing else to do.",
    "2953": "Try that a few more times, and you should worry about your head... Chief!",
    "2954": "Ahem, to keep our relationship fair and equal, as the Queen, I order you to... Hey! You\\'re trying some funny business with the shackles again!?",
    "2955": "Hey, hey, it\\'s so easy to order food over here, just look at the picture! *civilized Deus* Why are you looking at me with that look, huh? ...... For your information, I know quite a few words now! Don\\'t move to bring it up!",
    "2956": "...... It was quite tasty.",
    "2957": "I was worried that I would have to come out and fight with some monsters again, but it turned out that all of them were fried chicken fries, and you said that this would not be a trap for the dead soldiers to confuse us! ...... Forget about it! It would be nice if the black ring was like this every time--",
    "2958": "Wouldn\\'t it be better than that bitter stuff in your office? Tell you what, it wouldn\\'t be impossible to give you a taste ...... if you begged me.",
    "2959": "I don t know why that guy Ninety Nine only likes to eat grilled meat, obviously the burger is also quite good ...... When I have the opportunity next time, I will definitely bring her here to try it!",
    "2960": "Hey, let me ask you, is there something special about Thursdays over here? Why is it that every time this day comes, the people who come here to eat are saying strange things? What ...... would they say even if they don\\'t come? It\\'s weird ...... can\\'t figure out this place ......",
    "2961": "What for? Don\\'t talk to me while you\\'re eating! You want ketchup on your fries, not sweet and sour sauce? Ah...... don\\'t listen to the Director\\'s recitation!",
    "2962": "How about that, isn\\'t that a handsome fork! And ...... most importantly, it was given to me directly after those people took my picture! Heck, free stuff is always the best!",
    "2963": "There\\'s nothing to be happy about catching someone like me, right? Keep going. Good luck on catching a better Sinner next time.",
    "2964": "Wait. Do you think I\\'ll stop being lazy when I get stronger?",
    "2965": "Yeah, I\\'m so strong now! Is it time for me to get myself killed in Black Rings?",
    "2966": "Stay close... I have to at least take you back alive.",
    "2967": "Let\\'s go. It\\'s just a few corpses. Nothing interesting.",
    "2968": "Ha... We can finally go home early.",
    "2969": "You can\\'t escape!",
    "2970": "Can\\'t believe I got defeated here...",
    "2971": "You\\'re not expecting me to say hello to you, are you? You must have got too much time...",
    "2972": "You\\'ve got a grindstone? Jon and Jay are getting blunt. Why do I name my weapons? Nothing special. I just think it\\'s fun.",
    "2973": "You wanna chat with me? Don\\'t... I don\\'t wanna chat right now. You\\'d better chat with someone else.",
    "2974": "I can give you some odd jobs if you pay enough. Forget about fighting. I ain\\'t good enough for that.",
    "2975": "Hey, wanna make a deal? This week I\\'ll do whatever you tell me to. I promise, no slacking off... Can you help me buy that Deadlover Radio special collection?",
    "2976": "Every time I see K.K., I feel like seeing myself from the past—it\\'s too boring working all day long without any personal life. If I don\\'t watch her, she will be sold by Bai Yi to pay off gambling debts sooner or later.",
    "2977": "I know Bai Yi gets drunk, gambles, gets into trouble all the time, and calls me a dwarf when she gets drink too much... but she is the most interesting person in the world from the time I met her until now. It has always been the case.",
    "2978": "I\\'m surprised that you, as the Chief, with such a face, didn\\'t go suck up to those high officials instead of hanging out with a bunch of Sinners all day. You are an interesting one... Don\\'t get me wrong. I didn\\'t mean anything by that.",
    "2979": "You tired? Take a nap then. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll keep watch for you and won\\'t let your men know their great Chief is slacking off.",
    "2980": "Uh... Sis, what\\'s your problem?",
    "2981": "You do your work, I take my nap. Let\\'s not get in the way of each other, okay?",
    "2982": "Can you ask someone else to go? I\\'m busy.",
    "2983": "Let\\'s leave it at this. I\\'m off now.",
    "2984": "Tsk, what a pain.",
    "2985": "Ah... My eyes... It hurts... I\\'m gonna turn blind. Do you still want me to go like this? Geez.",
    "2986": "Watch out!",
    "2987": "Ok",
    "2988": "(Grunts)",
    "2989": "(Bellows)",
    "2990": "Hmm?",
    "2991": "Whoa!",
    "2992": "Wait. Do you think I\\'ll stop being lazy when I get stronger?",
    "2993": "Oh? It\\'s just you. I\\'m working here. Whitestone just took on a debt collection job, and K.K. is in the middle of something else, so I had to come. I\\'m wearing this to look more like a badass. It\\'s Bai Yi\\'s idea, not mine.",
    "2994": "Not again? It\\'s so tiring to fight and kill.",
    "2995": "The job is not done yet. Relax, I won\\'t do anything nasty. He\\'s open for business. If I sit here and stare at everyone, he\\'ll want me to leave and give me the money in no time.",
    "2996": "Ugh, out of all the jobs they could\\'ve picked, they had to go for this debt collection gig, and of course, they forced me to do it... Well, if I can\\'t get it done, so be it. It won\\'t be the first job Whitestone couldn\\'t finish anyway.",
    "2997": "If I keep sitting here, I\\'ll be seen as their security guy. The only good thing here is free tea and snacks. Hey, you really not gonna have some?",
    "2998": "Hey~ You don\\'t seem so busy. Why not join us in the back to play mahjong? Don\\'t worry, the boss here is my buddy, he won\\'t charge us.",
    "2999": "Don\\'t rub it. It\\'s not a tattoo, it\\'s just a sleeve. Why would I want to sting myself with some colorful needles?",
    "3000": "What brings you here? Well, not like it\\'s any of my business. If you have nothing better to do, it\\'s good to sit here and get some vitamin D from the sun too.",
    "3001": "Let me go! Let me go! I\\'m the biggest rascal of DisCity! You can\\'t capture me!",
    "3002": "There must be more exciting adventures waiting for me!",
    "3003": "My goodness, is this really mine? Can I go farm in Paradeisos now?",
    "3004": "Where are we going for an adventure this time?",
    "3005": "Victory! Let\\'s celebrate! I want some cola!",
    "3006": "Cough cough... I let them off easy on purpose!",
    "3007": "Taste this!",
    "3008": "Sob... I\\'m not done playing yet...",
    "3009": "Yoohoo, Chief! When can we get up to some mischief together? Hurry up, I\\'m so bored.",
    "3010": "Chief, I want to drink some cola! Please... I promise to brush my teeth!",
    "3011": "Great! As long as I can fight every day, I\\'ll be able to eat, drink and sleep well. The Bureau is such a great place - um... wait! Laziness seems like a bad thing, too! Marvelous! I\\'m the biggest rascal in DisCity!",
    "3012": "My grandpa said he always wanted to be a cowboy and explore the world, but in the end, he never left his hometown and remained a farmer all his life. To help him realize his dream, I stole and wore his hat! Haha!",
    "3013": "DisCity is huge! I couldn\\'t see the edge of the city even after running for three hours! In my hometown, I could plow all the farm plots combined within three hours... so, when can I go to Paradeisos to farm?",
    "3014": "Chief, if you run into thugs, just drop my name! It won\\'t be of much use, but at least it\\'ll give you some psychological support!",
    "3015": "I\\'ve been busy completing missions recently, so no time for mischief. If this keeps up, DisCity will forget my name. Well... it\\'s decided! I\\'m going to stay up all night!",
    "3016": "Chief! Let\\'s go farming! Let\\'s go treasure hunting! Let\\'s go fight those strange creatures! I can\\'t wait!",
    "3017": "Ahhh... when are we leaving? I\\'m already sleepy from waiting.",
    "3018": "What is it? Did my clothes get stained? No?",
    "3019": "Got any new plans?",
    "3020": "Off we go to an adventure in DisCity!",
    "3021": "Done! Quick, praise me!",
    "3022": "Start running!",
    "3023": "I\\'m cominggggg!",
    "3024": "Be careful!",
    "3025": "No problem!",
    "3026": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",
    "3027": "Haha, tremble before me, you fiends! The queen of lion dancing is here!",

    "3117": "Oh Chief, I didn\\'t expect you to remember me! Since you came, have a seat and let\\'s chat! I\\'m bored to death over here...",
    "3118": "One of my favorite things to do is saying \\\\\"no\\\\\" to arrogant guys... just kidding! I\\'ll go, I\\'ll go.",
    "3119": "EMP, glorious return!",
    "3120": "Combat power should exceed 5 by now!",
    "3121": "Do I have to go...",
    "3122": "Mmm!",
    "3123": "Mmm.",
    "3124": "(Grunts)",
    "3125": "(Bellows)",
    "3126": "What happened?",
    "3127": "Huh?!",
    "3128": "I told you a long time ago, I\\'m the strongest. Hey! Listen to me!",
    "3129": "After encountering the Uncrowned Queen in a dark alley, your first instinct is to walk towards me instead of running away. Now that\\'s something you don\\'t see every day! You\\'ve earned EMP\\'s admiration. Cough up your name.",
    "3130": "Come on, let\\'s go take a walk around the block. Hey don\\'t worry, no one in Syndicate would dare pick on EMP. By the way, you... walk in front of me.",
    "3131": "That... Minos Bureau of Crisis Control you mentioned, what do they usually do? Ah, it\\'s fine, don\\'t be nervous. As the boss, I just want to know how much mettle my underling\\'s got!",
    "3132": "I\\'ve resolved all the disorders around here lately! Now the only thing that interests me is scamming... Um, I mean, training talented people with great potential like you! You should keep learning from me!",
    "3133": "You see her? Next time you meet her, remember to call her Big Sis. Even though she\\'s only a few months old, she\\'s also a founding member of the gang! You must show her the respect she deserves.",
    "3134": "You\\'ve only been here for a few days and you\\'ve forgotten your place already?",
    "3135": "I haven\\'t seen that little thug with the water pipe in a while. I took a heavy blow from her last time and I haven\\'t fully recovered... If I see her again, I must repay her properly.",
    "3136": "Where are you going... The West District? Ahem, um... Nothing, I choked on something... But, are... are you sure? That\\'s the Legion\\'s territory.",
    "3137": "Thou hast discovered my secret... Then stay here with me forever! C\\'mon, quit gawking! This is the time for you to say, \\\\\"In your dream, Dreadlord! Not even over my dead body!\\\\\"",
    "3138": "Hehe, see this shining magic tattoo? I am not bald, and I get stronger!",
    "3139": "Hey, you\\'re just in time to see the love of my life. Isn\\'t it a masterpiece? Great storyboard and plot, right? What? The love of my life wasn\\'t this one last time we met? Ummm... Well, I just made the mistake that all manga otaku make!",
    "3140": "Ta-da! Check my babies out! This room of comics is the kingdom I have built for myself! Many are already out-of-print! Thanks to these treasures, I can usurp... ahem, I mean, achieve this lofty status in the comic club!",
    "3141": "If you sincerely want to read it, it\\'s not like I can\\'t lend it to you, but strings attached: first, you can\\'t soil the fold-outs; second, you can\\'t lend it to anyone else; and third, the next time I have to go stand in line to buy some special edition comic books, you will approve my leave permit.",
    "3142": "It\\'s the guy posting spoilers again! I have reported so many times but no use! This forum is garbage! Arghhhhh! You left me with no choice but to do this! Just wait and see, your server is gone!",
    "3143": "\\\\\"Hands off\\\\\" is rule No.1 of the adventure code, okay? If you continue to be so harum-scarum, you might trigger the spell sealed in my equipment. Humph, that\\'ll be fun to watch!",
    "3144": "It\\'s not that I\\'m stingy, but this is a random special edition that came with the limited color illustration! And I had to buy two other unsalable books to get it. I swore I\\'d never let it fall into the hands of outsiders!",
    "3145": "Eastside Firefighting Ambassador Flora reporting for duty! Wherever I am, not a single spark will appear! Really!",
    "3146": "This makes putting out fires a lot easier. You can look forward to my performance, Chief.",
    "3147": "If only I had this power before the big fire... but now, I can do more!",
    "3148": "Keep up! Don\\'t fall behind!",
    "3149": "Preparing to return. Currently at the handover scene.",
    "3150": "The fire is out of control.",
    "3151": "Spray with the hose!",
    "3152": "There are still people who are... who are...",
    "3153": "Good morning, Chief. Remember to check the fire equipment regularly. Safety first!",
    "3154": "I don\\'t like to use the firefighter\\'s ax... I always hurt my teammates by accident.",
    "3155": "My ex-coworkers always act weird around me. Am I being ostracized?",
    "3156": "Give me anything with a hose and I can put out a fire! Hehe... it\\'s just a matter of precision.",
    "3157": "Sorry, I don\\'t hate people who use flames as weapons, but... forget it. I will definitely keep an eye on them. After all, the best cure is prevention!",
    "3158": "I once thought I could also help others as a firefighting ambassador, until I saw the burning buildings and heard those wailing for help. It was then that I realized where I truly belonged: in the middle of a firestorm.",
    "3159": "I prefer long hair over short hair, but it\\'s really inconvenient to have long hair while fighting fires.",
    "3160": "Even though there are no fire hazards here, I get to help more people. Thank you, Chief... this was what I wanted.",
    "3161": "Uhhh... how high should I aim the hose? One sec! Let me check the manual.",
    "3162": "Don\\'t distract me! I need to train!",
    "3163": "It\\'s my job to teach you about fire safety! Please turn to the first page of the fire safety manual!",
    "3164": "Flora is all prepared and waiting to go.",
    "3165": "Mission accomplished. Flora has returned to the brigade!",
    "3166": "I\\'ve grown stronger again.",
    "3167": "Gear up and prepare to go!",
    "3168": "Danger!",
    "3169": "I understand.",
    "3170": "(Grunts)",
    "3171": "(Bellows)",
    "3172": "Hmm?",
    "3173": "Ahhh!",
    "3174": "This makes putting out fires a lot easier. You can look forward to my performance, Chief.",
    "3175": "If possible, I\\'d like to stay in the kitchen, preferably in cold storage... ah, sorry! I didn\\'t mean to trouble you. I promise not to do anything weird.",
    "3176": "Shiver... was that what it feels like in absolute zero?",
    "3177": "From now on, whether in cooking or in battle, I will never doubt myself again!",
    "3178": "There\\'s got to be a better candidate than me... right?",
    "3179": "We survived...! Thanks to everyone\\'s efforts.",
    "3180": "I always mess things up...",
    "3181": "Please don\\'t come over here!",
    "3182": "It\\'s so cold...",
    "3183": "It\\'s a bit hot today... Chief, I concocted a new flavor of shaved ice. Want to try it? You won\\'t be disappointed.",
    "3184": "Chief, you know which vegetable has the worst eyesight?... They all have equally bad eyesight, because vegetables don\\'t have eyes! Haha... ha... I\\'m sorry I suck at everything...!",
    "3185": "I can\\'t taste hot dishes, yet I dream of becoming a chef... sorry, you must think I\\'m weird.",
    "3186": "The DisCity Blue Ribbon Culinary School is the most prestigious cooking school of all time. Every student here will become a celebrity chef one day... everyone except me. I\\'ve repeated the same grade for three years already and still haven\\'t been able to graduate...",
    "3187": "To pass the exams and be accepted by everyone, I turned my back on the recipes that had accompanied me all my life. I learned \\\\\"normal\\\\\" recipes and made what I could never taste... later, I obtained my degree, but lost something more precious.",
    "3188": "I know my recipes aren\\'t the kind that everyone likes... but... low-temperature dishes have their own unique flavors. I really don\\'t want to give up on them!",
    "3189": "It\\'s scary to be \\\\\"different from everyone else\\\\\"... if everyone else thinks something is sweet, you must also think that it\\'s sweet... if everyone else thinks something is sour, you must also think that it\\'s sour... otherwise, you will become the \\\\\"weirdo\\\\\"...",
    "3190": "Thank you, Chief, for giving me a place to stay. Thank you for letting me cook whatever I want and for chatting with me, even though I make every conversation awkward... from now on, I will accommodate your wishes no matter what they are. I promise!",
    "3191": "Looks like I\\'m no longer needed here. Hmm... can I take a look in the kitchen? Just a peek.",
    "3192": "Eek! Ch-ch-chief... it\\'s too hot...",
    "3193": "Chief? Are you here to supervise me? I\\'m sorry, I won\\'t use the freezer behind your back... really.",
    "3194": "Um... can I shop for some ingredients on my way back?",
    "3195": "I\\'m sorry, Chief, I think... I have a heatstroke...",
    "3196": "... hmm? I think I sensed a bit of taste!",
    "3197": "... are you sure you want to leave this to me?",
    "3198": "Watch out!",
    "3199": "I... I understand.",
    "3200": "(Grunts)",
    "3201": "(Bellows)",
    "3202": "Hmm?",
    "3203": "Ahhh!",
    "3204": "Shiver... was that what it feels like in absolute zero?",
    "3205": "This feels nice... Ah! Ch-Chief! Wh... when did you come? I\\'m sorry, but can I please stay here for a bit longer...? I\\'ll definitely clean up the fridge later!",
    "3206": "That\\'ll bring the temperature down...",
    "3207": "Chief, would you care to join me? It\\'s different from the icehouse of the Blue Ribbon Culinary School. It doesn\\'t give you goosebumps at all! It feels just right.",
    "3208": "If anyone saw me like this, words about me being a \\\\\"giant weirdo\\\\\" will surely be spread even further. What? You think it\\'s not bad? Hehehe... That\\'s nice.",
    "3209": "I\\'ve got an idea! Before we go out to the pool, why don\\'t we make some snow cones with these fruits? They\\'ll be perfect for relieving summer heat!",
    "3210": "One day, the strawberry cone and the chocolate cone swam together in a race. Guess who won? The answer is neither, because they both melted in the sea! Ah... I\\'m sorry... I must be delirious from the heat to tell this horrible joke... You don\\'t have to force yourself to laugh!",
    "3211": "Oh! Your hands are so cold, not quite the same as usual! It seems to be even more chilling than liquid nitrogen! Hmm? Is this... the power of the shackles? Amazing!",
    "3212": "I thought I\\'d packed the right clothes for summer, but they are still not cool enough. I was this close to becoming one of the water vaporizers...",
    "3213": "Hmph. Finally found me. It\\'s fine. As long as the guitar is still here, anywhere will do.",
    "3214": "Yes, that\\'s it! Quick, give me a paper and pen! A new tune came to me, I need to jot it down!",
    "3215": "I can wow the audience even with a harp.",
    "3216": "Go, Krist.",
    "3217": "Done!",
    "3218": "What a **** performance.",
    "3219": "Solo time!",
    "3220": "Can\\'t even... get into... a 27-year-old club... hahaha...",
    "3221": "Good timing. Let me hear your demo.",
    "3222": "As long as I\\'m still alive, those records companies can fuck off. No way in hell would I let them steal Anavrin\\'s songs.",
    "3223": "My favorite food? Coffee with milk, and strawberry cake... what did you expect? You thought I could live on alcohol alone?",
    "3224": "My dad always used to say that God blessed me with musical talent so I wouldn\\'t take the wrong path... Haha, pity I don\\'t believe in God, nor did I choose the right path.",
    "3225": "Back then, our lead singer would always holler about burning this city to ashes. Ironically, he became the first of the bunch to burn to ashes.",
    "3226": "Maybe because it happened so long ago, but I don\\'t hate her so much anymore. As long as she stops plotting against Anavrin, she can do whatever she wants. I won\\'t stop her anymore.",
    "3227": "When this is all over... If that day comes, I want to keep on performing. Of course, I\\'ll leave you a front row seat. Don\\'t you dare not show up.",
    "3228": "In the past few years, all I had was this guitar. Now... I don\\'t want to sound corny, but thank you for being by my side.",
    "3229": "But I\\'m a creep, I\\'m a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here? I don\\'t belong here.",
    "3230": "Get lost!",
    "3231": "Of course I care about the audience, but don\\'t wag your finger at me and bullshit before the song is even finished. Got it?",
    "3232": "Perfect! I can meet some old friends on the way.",
    "3233": "Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be.",
    "3234": "New riff, not bad.",
    "3235": "Bass drummer, get ready! The performance is about to start!",
    "3236": "Something\\'s off.",
    "3237": "Got it.",
    "3238": "(Grunts)",
    "3239": "(Bellows)",
    "3240": "Hmm?",
    "3241": "What\\'s that?!",
    "3242": "Yes, that\\'s it! Quick, give me a paper and pen! A new tune came to me, I need to jot it down!",
    "3243": "Hi, I\\'m Macchiato, client manager at Eastside Bank. Would you like to try our program... ah, you\\'re the Chief here? My apologies. I subconsciously spew these lines whenever I meet someone new. I will definitely cooperate with you.",
    "3244": "Is this what you wanted? I see. I will satisfy you.",
    "3245": "Get ready for an unprecedented feast for the senses.",
    "3246": "I will give everyone the motivation to keep going.",
    "3247": "My hand is sore... but I\\'m very happy.",
    "3248": "What do I do, it\\'s over... I\\'m going to die...",
    "3249": "Feel the joy with your heart...",
    "3250": "I can\\'t die... I still have to...",
    "3251": "Chief, you\\'re back? I put yesterday\\'s work report on your desk already. Would you like something to drink? Coffee, tea or something else? I\\'ll prepare it for you.",
    "3252": "Physical pain is short-lived, but mental pleasure brings long-lasting satisfaction—or so they say. Would you like to try it?",
    "3253": "Eastside Bank\\'s new wealth management program is superb! It\\'s low-risk, high-return and boasts an annualized return of 12%. I joined it myself. Chief, are you really not going to consider it?",
    "3254": "It\\'s good to have a nine-to-five job. This way, I\\'ll have enough time to pursue my \\\\\"hobbies\\\\\".",
    "3255": "When my younger siblings get jobs, I will truly be free. When that day comes, I want to become a truck driver in Sandsea, or a rock drummer in the Syndicate... as long as I can leave Eastside.",
    "3256": "Life in Eastside is too depressing. Sales quotas, debts, stocks, emotions... Everyone has countless things to worry about. Maybe that\\'s why they need me.",
    "3257": "This might sound a bit ungrateful, but I dislike the title \\\\\"Dominatrix\\\\\"... However, if it\\'s what you desire, Chief, I\\'m willing to be your personal dominatrix.",
    "3258": "In the past, I somewhat resisted this power and identity. But ever since you showed up, I realized that satisfaction truly does exist... perhaps I\\'m addicted to you, dear Chief.",
    "3259": "Welcome to Eastside Bank! Oh, I mean MBCC... sorry, I was dozing off just now.",
    "3260": "If you\\'re really stressed, I can help you destress.",
    "3261": "I\\'ve never been a secretary before. What do I need to do? Is satisfying all of your needs enough?",
    "3262": "I will complete this mission for sure.",
    "3263": "Mission accomplished. Who do I find to write off the expenses?",
    "3264": "Thank you for your support.",
    "3265": "It might hurt a little. Is that fine?",
    "3266": "Please be more careful.",
    "3267": "I see.",
    "3268": "(Grunts)",
    "3269": "(Bellows)",
    "3270": "Hmm?",
    "3271": "Ahhh!",
    "3272": "Is this what you wanted? I see. I will satisfy you.",
    "3273": "Sure, if that\\'s what you need, I\\'ll raise the whip for you again... to satisfy the deepest desire within you.",
    "3274": "How about that? Do you feel light as a feather now?",
    "3275": "Do you want a reward from me too? That\\'s all right, don\\'t be shy... I will accept every side of you.",
    "3276": "Sure you can\\'t go on? Hang in there a little longer. I promise to take you to heaven at just the right moment... Trust me... I know your limits quite well.",
    "3277": "Here, open your mouth. This is your reward for being obedient and cooperative... Let\\'s enjoy it together.",
    "3278": "Ah... Very nice, everyone is sated...",
    "3279": "Are you so eager? Then get into position, and don\\'t move around...",
    "3280": "If you want it, just nod, and I\\'ll show you... the sweetest reward.",
    "3281": "Arresting someone without evidence? What a good dog you are. I must say, this tasteless dump really suits you.",
    "3282": "Ugh, don\\'t annoy me with matters unrelated to art.",
    "3283": "Who cares about powerful illusions? They can never replace real paintbrushes.",
    "3284": "You need to keep up. I\\'m not going to wait for you if you fall behind.",
    "3285": "It is your honor to enjoy my feast for the senses.",
    "3286": "What a failure.",
    "3287": "How tacky! It must be destroyed!",
    "3288": "Is beauty always fleeting?",
    "3289": "How are you planning to waste your worthless life today? Actually, there\\'s no need to answer. I\\'m not interested. It was just a polite greeting on my part.",
    "3290": "When I got into that car accident, half the Eastside art world secretly cheered. Those crass imbeciles didn\\'t realize that as a painter, I simply stole some of their business, but as a critic, I could destroy them completely.",
    "3291": "What\\'s the difference between those mindless paintings and that useless head on your shoulders?",
    "3292": "There is no authoritative standard for artistic expression. It\\'s delusional to think that a few million DisCoins can define the value of a work. These Eastside upstarts are even shallower than you.",
    "3293": "Can I use your art forum account? I just wrote a review, but when I tried to post it, I discovered that my account had been banned.",
    "3294": "Don\\'t give up just because I always say you\\'re worthless! You have merits too! For example, you\\'re... um... you\\'re kind!",
    "3295": "I\\'m the critic who has made the biggest contribution to improving the art world. How dare they call me a shrew? Fine. I\\'ll be the shrew as long as my words can awaken those incompetent fools.",
    "3296": "Upon closer inspection, your face is actually kind of good looking... what a pity, we met too late. No chance to paint a portrait of you and keep it now.",
    "3297": "Sigh! Turned out crooked again... My hand can\\'t even draw a straight line anymore...",
    "3298": "You are hopelessly tacky!",
    "3299": "Unless you\\'ve suddenly become enlightened enough to discuss the role of color in the emotional expression of the painting <i>Rebecca<\/i>, don\\'t bother me. I have several critiques to write, and I have no time to waste with you.",
    "3300": "Just don\\'t take me anywhere tacky.",
    "3301": "Have you been waiting here all this time? Seems like the position of Chief is an idle job.",
    "3302": "Thank you... why, is it weird for me to say thank you?",
    "3303": "These hideous things really disgust me. Let\\'s get this over with.",
    "3304": "Are you blind?",
    "3305": "Alright.",
    "3306": "(Grunts)",
    "3307": "(Bellows)",
    "3308": "Hmm?",
    "3309": "Ah!",
    "3310": "Ugh, don\\'t annoy me with matters unrelated to art.",
    "3311": "Surprised to see me? It\\'s nice and quiet here. I won\\'t be disturbed. It\\'s the perfect place for writing my critiques.",
    "3312": "Comment sent. Now, onto the next one...",
    "3313": "If you\\'re not put off by my comments of you from head to toe, there\\'s an empty chair over there for you.",
    "3314": "The cocoon has turned into a butterfly after a winter on the branch. The once-dead hyacinth is now budding again... So many miracles can happen in the greenhouse... What about in life?",
    "3315": "Ha, they call me jealous? Why should I be jealous of those speculators who know nothing other than marketing? All that publicity can\\'t hide the fact that their works are trash.",
    "3316": "I can see a hint of creativity here... but the use of colors is too boring... It can be bolder...",
    "3317": "The plants here are in need of some fertilizer... I see you\\'re quite the material for it, huh?",
    "3318": "As the Chief, have you got nothing else to do besides staring at me? Go water the plants if you\\'re so bored. The watering can is right there."
