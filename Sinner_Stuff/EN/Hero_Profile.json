    "Criminal Record 1": "The suspect for attempted murder of the to-be Speaker of the City Council Abel Schilder at the City Council election speech, then violently resisted arrest, severely injuring dozens of Special Task Force members. In the following several years, the subject continued to carry out assualt against officials of the City Council, and was never caught.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "An anonymous source reveals that the DisCity Councilor serial murder case contains multiple discrepancies, such as the use of Mania weapons and the severe disfiguring mutation of the corpses. The 9th Agency's investigation has confirmed that the case is related to Parma and corrupt city councilors. The subject suffered a certain degree of false accusation and was followed by hired assassins for several years.",
    "Ability Summary": "With the strategic shield, hostile attacks can be warded off within a short period and morale of allies can be effectively boosted. These effects are especially effective on Demon himself.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject's ability awakened at the scene of Abel's murder. This case consists of many suspicious details. The reports suggest that the subject erupted in intense rage and hatred at the time, but more details are to be verified in further interrogations.",
    "Corruption State": "All cognitive assessments and physical examinations have returned normal results. The subject's corruption level is low and his mind is clear, with no physical signs of mutation detected.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject escaped the Special Task Force's siege and was on the run for years, during which he violently resisted arrest repeatedly. The MBCC and FAC joined forces to send out a large number of police officers and eventually arrested the subject after making a great deal of sacrifice.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Demon Schilder, formerly named Demon Borne, was born in Syndicate. In N.F. 95, Demon was adopted by councilor Abel Schilder and later became a captain of the Special Task Force under the FAC.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "During the time when he was the FAC's Special Task Force's captain, Demon was proactive with his duties and helped Abel gain support from a considerable portion of Eastside's population. After the incident, the subject was struck off and besieged by the Special Task Force.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Investigation shows that the real culprit of Able's death is an opposition party. During the election speech, Abel was showing signs of mutation after being attacked by a Mania Weapon, and the subject had no choice but to end his life. A family member, Vera Schilder, was kidnapped by Parma lab after the incident, and is now confirmed to be dead.",
    "Performance 1": "Possesses excellent shooting and wrestling skills and is well-known for that, so is frequently challenged by other Sinners. When this kind of situation occurs, no need to alert security, as the row will typically be resolved within five minutes. When it's over, please be reminded to notify the medical staff.",
    "Performance 2": "Pretty receptive to media such as novels, comics, music, and films. Mostly spends his free time reading literary works. Since the subject spent most of his energy on fighting at work in the past, he hasn't yet found any hobbies he's passionate about.",
    "Performance 3": "Demon is especially patient and kind toward younger Sinners, and does not usually strike back directly when encountering those Sinners' provocations and attacks. He even tries to catch up on those young Sinners' fashion and interests despite finding it very hard to chime in on these discussions.",
    "Performance 4": "Having always thought his presence will bring bad luck to people around him, the subject's tendency of self-destruction is getting more serious after having learned about Vera's death. The only time this tendency is under control is when battling together with Chief."

    "Criminal Record 1": "OwO is an immigrant who hails from a satellite town in Outland. Cute as a button, she was adored and pampered by every household in Drifter Camp. OwO was set on keeping alive the family tradition of lion dancing, but due to her young age and the obscurity of the art form, she was virtually unknown outside Drifter Camp. It's not until the release of her blockbuster that she started attracting public attention.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Investigation reveals that the subject's power awakened due to her instinct to protect a stranger in an emergency situation. She is in fact kind and innocent, highly resistant to contamination, and mentally stable. She got into a series of accidents and disputes due to her ignorance about Sinners and the related regulations. Under the Bureau's education and monitoring, there have been no similar occurrences since.",

    "Arrest Records 2": "OwO's parents joined the Goldionville Caravan as a way to better their situation. The family of three traveled with the caravan to DisCity. Later on, OwO's parents, convinced that DisCity would be a better place for OwO to grow up in, entrusted her to a trustworthy fellow clansman from Drifter Camp, where she was adored and pampered by the locals. Because of her upbringing, she has become a willful character who throws tantrums when things don't go her way and who never hides her pleasure when compliments come her way.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Following in her parents' footsteps, OwO took up lion dancing, and she has an all-consuming love of the art form. OwO has a giant lion head that she carries with her at all times. According to OwO herself, she and her parents once found themselves in grave peril on their way to DisCity, and she escaped unhurt by, at her parents' urge, hiding inside the lion head. So to her, it is more than just a symbol of good luck; it's a holy object that has protected her and her loved ones all this way.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "OwO grew up in DisCity, but under the influence of her family, she wholeheartedly adopted the customs of her distant hometown. She felt like a misfit growing up, and loneliness was a constant companion. That's how the idea of one day returning to her hometown to reunite with her clansmen was planted.",
    "Performance 1": "OwO is insolent and willful, but it's hard not to have affection for her. She became one of the most popular figures in the MBCC almost instantly, sneaking her way into the hearts of many of the Sinners and staffers.",
    "Performance 2": "OwO is a big fan of Movie Night, an event organized by the MBCC in the recreation area on a regular basis. She never misses a movie, and nothing makes her tick like old-time kung fu movies. When caught up in the moment, she'll jump up and start swinging her arms and kicking her legs.",
    "Performance 3": "OwO and Dudu are close; they reportedly come from the same place, and that's why they have so much to say to each other. OwO once did a lion dance accompanied by Dudu on Suona, but the effect left much to be desired.",
    "Performance 4": "At first, OwO's unruliness was a real headache for Chief. But after spending time with her, Chief has figured out a way to deal with her. OwO is a crybaby who flouts rules and raises hell, but she can always be calmed down by a well-placed, well-timed compliment."

    "Criminal Record 1": "Born in Syndicate, she signed up with the FAC during her youthful days. After breezing through the initiation, she made her way to the FAC's elite division, showcasing her skills on the frontlines for over a decade.\nYet, in N.F. 103, tragedy struck when her squad met its end in the DisSea. This drove her to the edge, leading her to lash out at the top brass. She might have cooled down since, but whispers say she's plotting something big and dangerous.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Upon the Chief's deep dive, it's clear the subject's been brainwashed, now puppeteered by some shadowy figure from Paradeisos. This sinister influence led her to throw wrenches in our investigations and even lash out at Chief. But there's hope. Thanks to Chief's shackle abilities, this mind grip is loosening. The subject's starting to piece together her memories, and their hostile edge seems to be dulling.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject has an innate defensive power tailored specifically to shield those she's fiercely loyal to.\nAfter enduring the loss of someone she first vowed to protect, she recognized that just sitting back and defending wasn't enough. To truly protect, she had to be assertive and take action. That's when she mastered the skill to convert her defensive strength into raw, destructive power.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Rumor has it that the subject, desperate for the \"ultimate power of revenge,\" voluntarily used Mania Crystals. Fighting against its Mania corruption, she held onto her sanity and emerged as one of the Sinners.",
    "Corruption State": "After using the Mania Crystals, she's deeply corrupted. She can suddenly lash out, tormented by sharp pain and illusions. This becomes especially noticeable when she's in a fight.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "After the events at Erica Villa, the subject disappeared without a trace. However, a few months later, she came back. Because her true role as a Sinner came to light, she was moved to MBCC. While it was publicly labeled as a simple \"work transfer,\" she was actually being detained as a Sinner.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "She worked on the front lines at FAC for over a decade, joining countless missions. In July, N.F. 113, she requested some time off from her boss, Conrad Cage, and headed solo to Erica Villa. She vanished for a few months, and when she finally came back, she wouldn't talk about what happened during that period.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "From Syndicate, Varna Yano, captain of the FAC's G-47 squad, brought the subject back after some mission. Once trained, the subject became an integral part of Varna's crew. However, in N.F. 103, tragedy struck: G-47 was wiped out. This catastrophe threw the subject into a spiral of severe PTSD, leading her to make some reckless decisions. Thanks to the FAC's medical team, she found her way back. But because of this dark chapter, she's always been overlooked for promotions within the FAC.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Following the mysterious assassination of Conrad Cage, there were whispers in the Bureau that she might have leaked some info that sealed his fate. But after a whirlwind of events, Chief shot down that theory. Still, playing it safe, they've kept a close eye on the subject.",
    "Performance 1": "In the thick of MBCC missions, the subject stands out with an uncanny knack for battle. She's not just in sync with MBCC teammates but also gels seamlessly with other Sinners. More often than not, she'll step up to shield Chief, a habit that probably traces back to her distinct fighting flair during her time at FAC.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject has been heavily affected by Mania, battling severe migraines and hearing voices that aren't there. She has a noticeable aggressive side too. But her remarkable strength of will has so far kept her from acting on these dark urges. However, we should be on high alert around her.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject wields a shield, the GH-4 close-combat gauntlet from the Ring Research Institute. It wasn't initially designed to be deadly. The glowing blade that she uses during combat comes from her own power.",
    "Performance 4": "Lately, the subject has been shadowing Chief everywhere. When asked about this behavior, she claim it's to protect Chief, and also to supervise, ensuring the Chief doesn't step out of line."

According to observation logs, the subject shows some response to external stimuli but lacks further interest. However, she exhibits strong emotional fluctuations and mental agitation when Chief presents to her a certain pocket watch.",
    "Performance 3": "Due to the subject's habit of logging her observations, while she's being closely observed and documented, the subject also observes and studies Chief at a close distance. Her research materials have now been compiled into a volume.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject is highly experienced in vehicle operation. She once evaded arrests and fled the Bureau with Chief and later returned voluntarily on the same day. The subject offered no explanation for this, but according to Chief, she simply turned back after observing the Black Ring for a brief moment.

The degree of projection depends on her mental strength and the physical capabilities of those being projected. There has been at least one documented case where a person's entire existence was directly and completely projected into her story.

    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject was born into a prestigious family in Eastia. Her parents worked in artistic fields and maintained a harmonious relationship. Growing up in a happy and loving family, she received an excellent education, read extensively, and never experienced significant setbacks. Because happiness came too easily, she lacked a concrete understanding of the idea of hardship.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject's family later relocated to escape the frequent disasters. During their flight, she witnessed the true face of catastrophe outside of books for the first time. The despair and suffering of people shook her immensely, marking the beginning of her later obsession with tragic destruction.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "After recognizing her obsession with tragedy, she decided to embark on journeys, constantly seeking out cities in turmoil. She collected the stories of their downfall, which she would then dramatize and retell. Over time, her reputation as a storyteller became an urban legend that spread throughout Eastia and eventually reached DisCity after diplomacy between the two regions was established. Currently, she voluntarily remains at the Minos Bureau of Crisis Control, claiming she wishes to stay near Chief to witness the city's ending.",
    "Performance 1": "During the early period of detention, the subject adapted well, maintaining her customary unhurried pace of life. The Bureau's library became her most frequented location, where the rich collection of DisCity stories provided her with abundant inspiration for her tragic narratives.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject is considerably knowledgeable about flower planting, yet plants under her care inexplicably wither. Unlike other Sinners who lack gardening skills, she is not discouraged by this outcome. Rather, she takes pleasure in it, finding a unique beauty in withered plants.",

Additionally, she regularly holds storytelling sessions where she adapts and narrates new tales she has gathered.",

Allegedly involved in over a dozen crimes including armed confrontation, arms trade, assault, etc. Took over and eliminated other gangs by illegal means and incited a new wave of unrest within Syndicate, escalating the violent conflicts in Syndicate within a short time and causing serious casualties across a wide area.\nThe subject's use of her power to subvert Syndicate's order severely disrupted the West District Public Security Bureau's management. The subject crossed the line and Public Security Bureau of the West District requested sent multiple requests to FAC to eliminate Zoya.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "In her daily life in detention and on missions, the subject has frequently offered help to Chief. Besides, considering her actions during the containment of BR-004 and the retrieval of the Corpuscle, it's evident that her true character is considerably different than what's described in the FAC's records. She's likely not a blind supporter of violence and chaos. Despite the subject's past conflicts with the MBCC, her interests are now aligned with the Bureau's.",
    "Ability Summary": "The epitome of pure physical strengthening, the subject possesses shocking power. Combined with the excellent fighting skills gained from years of training, the subject's unarmed fighting ability has pushed beyond the recorded limits of human beings.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Investigation shows that the subject ambushed a gang hideout alone many years ago and was injured by a heavy mania weapon. The infection awakened the subject to her special powers and she gained control over it in no time, singlehandedly butchering the enemies at the hideout.",
    "Corruption State": "Possesses impressive adaptability to one's special power, resisting almost all possible side effects the Mania can cause. No matter what tests or stimulation are applied, no signs of mutation can be detected. The subject's mental and physical conditions both remain exceptionally stable.",
    "Performance 1": "No one had believed the Legion's leader would turn herself in to the MBCC, so Zoya's appearance caused quite a stir. Due to the large number of her admirers, Zoya has immense influence and appeal. This requires close attention by the Bureau.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject occupied a communal lounge without approval, modified it into a *head office* with the personal signature purple and black color tones, and stored a large volume of common arms from unknown sources. Since no staff dared to stop her, the MBCC decided to turn a blind eye to this.",
    "Performance 3": "Despite being revered by all Sinners with common sense, the subject never tries to put on airs in everyday life and treats everyone as comrades, teaching them fighting techniques personally. Certain Sinners are deeply touched by this and have even expressed their wish to join the *West District Legion*.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject probably started saying *Chief* half-jokingly out of condescending humor, but she now uses the title out of genuine respect for a friend. Apparently, after spending much time together, there have been some changes in the subject's attitude toward the MBCC and Chief."

    "Criminal Record 2": "Since her detention, the subject's severe Mania mutation has been alleviated with Chief's help, and rumors about sightings of the so-called *Sinner Grim Reaper* have gradually died down.\nIn addition, the assistance and care the subject receives from other Sinners in the MBCC have lowered her risk of contagion to the minimum. She's now virtually harmless to society.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject's special power can drain the life of living beings with means beyond scientific explanation, which will continue the subject's life.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Used to suffer from illness where crystals constantly grew on her body. The crystals and the explosion resonated and gave the subject special powers and new life.

Further interrogation is needed after psychiatric treatment.",

The subject spent 6 years living in a nursing home, \"Lakeside Residence\", during which her will to live came from the the rising sun under the Black Ring.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "After the Black Ring's eruption, the subject wandered around in areas around the DisSea for many years in a mentally unstable state. When wandering around the DisSea, the subject constantly shifted between the controlled and power awakened states, due to the strong desire to survive. The subjective consciousness of the subject seems to have no intention to harm humans.",
    "Performance 1": "Close to becoming a Corruptor, the subject has been given \"extra care\" by the FAC and quarantined with the highest defense standard. No normal humans are allowed to go near the room.",

    "Performance 3": "Rarely approaches people due to contamination, but does not resist friendly socialization with some Syndicate Sinners. Being born before the DisSea explosion, only Syndicate has traces of the life of that era the subject is familiar with.",
    "Performance 4": "Under Chief's guarantee and supervision, the FAC finally treats NOX less harshly, and her cheerful personality gradually started to restore. But after a series of events, the humanity in her was completely gone."

    "Case": "Public Property & Stampede Incident",
    "Criminal Record 1": "Deren used to be a talented filmmaker of great renown. She was well-versed in filmmaking and was called the Master of Grotesque Romcom. But she has since stopped making movies, for reasons unknown.\nIn the Blockbuster Films Incident, the unleashing of her power wrecked public property and caused a large-scale stampede. She should be detained as soon as possible.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject's works still contain residual Mania effect. With her permission, they have all been removed to eradicate possible contamination.\nHaving spent time with Chief during the blockbuster films incident and in the Bureau, the subject gradually begins to trust Chief and becomes more willing to open up. Chief's talks with the subject have been effective. Though her mindset is yet to be entirely shaken, she's not as pessimistic and indifferent as before.",
    "Ability Summary": "Deren's power allows her to turn what she imagines into reality. She can turn the script or whatever she's holding into a sharp, heavy weapon by thinking about it, and she can also acquire a close approximation of the abilities of a powerful superhero by picturing herself being that superhero.",
    "Awakening Signs": "According to available data, Deren's M-value might have reached the power-awakening threshold after she was exposed to an unidentified source of Mania some time ago. She then became an S-Class Sinner after experiencing mood swings while making movies. It's suspected that her movies can subject viewers to a certain level of Maniac contamination, so as a precaution, the MBCC, upon getting Deren's agreement, pulled all her movies out of circulation.",
    "Corruption State": "Deren awakened her power relatively early, and suffers only from a low level of Maniac corruption, with no abnormalities found on her body. Most of the time, she's mentally stable; but her mental state is liable to become unstable when she is making movies.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "During the investigation of Blockbuster Films Incident, Chief met Deren, who had been assisting OwO with film production. While resolving the crisis, Deren's powers were unleashed, causing a series of accidents including damage to public property and people being trampled. After the incident was resolved, she sought help from Chief and agreed to be detained by the MBCC.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "A well-known director whose work won many DisCars, Deren was regarded in the film industry as a rare talent. She was well-versed in many aspects of filmmaking, such as writing, camerawork, soundtrack, and editing. She is also observant; she is attuned to people's feelings but knows when to step back to better dissect these feelings. She masterfully wove together the characters, the story, and the mood into a breathtaking work of art.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The movie Deren had intended to submit for DisCars consideration was dark yet romantic. Based on what she had observed, the movie brought to light the struggle and outcry of those trapped in the darkness. But under pressure from the film distributor and investors to improve their chances of winning, Deren agreed to have the movie re-edited by someone else. The re-edited version won many DisCars, but it failed to convey the message in the director's cut.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Deren didn't attend the DisCars ceremony that year, nor did she give any interviews. She received many compliments for the movie, but the compliments were nothing more than a flattering label. She left Eastside and gave up her directing career. She became nonchalant and indolent, putting up a shield of indifference to protect herself against the absurdity of the world and the stupidity of her followers.",
    "Performance 1": "Deren has been nonchalant and indolent ever since she arrived at the MBCC. She goes about her business, including tasks assigned to her, without much enthusiasm, although she seems to agree with everything, never raising objections.",
    "Performance 2": "Deren has the habit of springing jokes on her interlocutors, jokes that often leave them lost for words. If a joke falls flat, she won't feel upset; she'll just smile, eyes narrowed, and turn around and leave.",
    "Performance 3": "Deren carries a pen and notebook in person wherever she goes. If she notices something interesting during a conversation or sees something interesting as she goes about her life, she will whip out the pen and notebook and make a note or two. You've learned that the notes she makes are ideas for movies and material that she can use in movies. To most people, the notebook is more like an unsavory collection of their embarrassing deeds.",
    "Performance 4": "Deren once offered to make a documentary about the MBCC, but Chief declined, saying that the existence of the MBCC should be kept a secret. But she's persistent, still busy convincing Chief to give her permission to make movies based on the life stories of the Sinners."

    "Criminal Record 2": "Given the significant role the subject played in the reconstruction of West District, he is allowed more freedom to move around as he pleases.

    "Awakening Signs": "The subject claims that he awakened a very long time ago, dating back to as early as his teenage years when he fought gang members on the streets, but he doesn't explain the specifics.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject was treated inhumanely after N.F. 104 as he suffered a mental breakdown, and his ability went out of control for a while. But after treatment, he is cured and mentally stable, showing no obvious signs of Mania.",

    "Arrest Records 3": "After the mining incident, the subject was confirmed to be under the control of a subordinate organization affiliated with the Nirvana Group, forced to make a public speech betraying Rustfire. He was then sent to Banyan Fourth Hospital for research on the stimulus and intensification of Sinner Mania. After a mental breakdown, he was abandoned and handed over to Dr. Das Alz.",

Due to the frequency and intensity of these conversations, he has received numerous complaints.",
    "Performance 2": "For unknown reasons, the subject rarely uses his Sinner abilities. However, thanks to his superior physical capabilities and combat skills, he can easily handle most combat scenarios.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject has an excellent relationship with his aunt. He often invites the Chief and his close Sinner friends to his aunt's place for a visit and to taste her homemade stew.",
    "Performance 4": "With the Chief's special approval, the subject was allowed to walk around freely in the MBCC, traveling to the West District, Eastside, and many other places to support the reconstruction of the West District."

    "Criminal Record 1": "A mysterious woman who appeared in Chief's dream, foretelling the calamity of the Ten Scorching Suns. Her true identity is unknown, but she is suspected to have a deep connection with the S-Class Apostle of Ashes - Sun Crow who wreaked havoc across the Eastian continent.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject has returned to WhiteSands, fighting against the Tide of Ashes by instinct. Her threat level is currently deemed low, and Paradeisos has arranged for personnel to closely monitor her. Emergency measures will be taken immediately if any danger arises.",
    "Ability Summary": "This special power allows precise control over physically inextinguishable flames. These flames disregard physical combustion points and burn everything they touch, tainting it deeply with Mania until the subject stops the attack or the target is completely destroyed.",
    "Awakening Signs": "According to the MBCC Chief's investigation, the subject had awakened as a Sinner before the Eastian disasters. At the time, her ability was a channeling Mania power very commonly seen in Eastia. Later, her power underwent significant changes for unknown reasons during Eastia's ten-sun disaster in N.F. 106.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject's body is covered in contamination, closely resembling that of the Apostle of Ashes - Sun Crow. With a high level of corruption, she relies on the shackles to suppress the Mania and maintain a certain degree of human mentality.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "After *Ten Scorching Suns* ended, with the Apostle of Ashes - Sun Crow defeated, the MBCC's Chief temporarily lost connection with the Sinner. Later, with the help of Eastian Sinner Yanyan, a child form of the alleged target Sinner was found in the heart of WhiteSands.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "After the defeat of the Sun Crow Apostle, the subject was reborn as a child. Chief personally cared for her and suppressed the Sun Crow Apostle's Mania power inside her with the shackles, thus keeping her sane and preventing her from turning into an Apostle.\nThe Bureau collected samples of her flames during her sleep and sent them to Paradeisos for evaluation. Chief's judgment proved correct. It is indeed Sinner Yao's ability and the juvenile Sinner's identity is confirmed as *Yao*.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject has been growing at an astonishing rate. In just a few months, she has grown into an adult female form. However, her consciousness and cognition are still in need of guidance and she still exhibits animalistic, instinctual behaviors, and sometimes even goes into an Apostle-like state. Close attention from all staff is constantly required.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "It has been confirmed that the Bureau's Tide of Ashes alarm was triggered by an unrecorded Apostle of Ashes lurking in the depths of WhiteSands. This Apostle's power is comparable to that of Sinner Yao. This has led the authorities to believe their power shares the same source and that as the subject's ability grows, the corresponding power of the Apostle of Ashes will also intensify. Therefore, Paradeisos has made an exception and approved the continuous detention and supervision of the subject by the Minos Bureau of Crisis Control. However, the Chief of the Bureau is to closely monitor the subject and her growth for information necessary for deductions about the Apostle of Ashes.\nIt is noted that the subject is currently allowed to reside in WhiteSands and return to the Bureau regularly for examinations and interrogation.",
    "Performance 1": "During the early stages of detention, as the subject was still very young and didn't have perfect control of her power, she would sometimes leak out sporadic flames unknowingly, burning a total of thirty-seven items in the Bureau. Following repeated reminders from Chief, she's begun learning to control it, and the staff also make sure not to let flammable objects near her.",
    "Performance 2": "Due to her animalistic nature, the subject sometimes demonstrates non-human behaviors such as flying, eating without utensils, and sleeping while standing. As long as she doesn't disrupt the normal operations of the Bureau, Chief and the staff generally do not intervene in these behaviors.",
    "Performance 3": "Upon reaching adulthood, the subject can communicate normally with people. However, perhaps inheriting part of her *parent*'s temperament (real reason to be explored), she doesn't always tell the truth, and the genuineness of her words requires verification. Currently, having mistakenly believed what she says, some Sinners have begun to sleep standing, believing they can grow wings for flying that way.",
    "Performance 4": "Having spent her childhood alongside Chief, the subject displays complete trust and a certain dependency on Chief. After returning to her life in WhiteSands, she regularly returns to the Bureau for examinations and to visit Chief. Chief stores the fiery feathers left behind by the subject during each visit in a special storage box in the office."

    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject was born in a coastal fishing town. Due to her flawed personality, she was highly unsociable and spent most of her time alone in the sea.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Intensifying disasters eventually forced all industries in the fishing town to come to a halt. Like many local residents, her parents chose to relocate in search of new opportunities. She had to leave the sea behind, struggling to blend in as a normal person.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "In N.F. 22, the subject joined the DisSea Expedition as a diver. While her assignments were significantly more dangerous and demanding than those of regular divers, she was unfazed by these challenges.\nThe subject preferred staying in the ocean to navigating the complexities of human interactions.",

It was only after the Chief personally promised to check on her nightly—whenever possible—that she reluctantly agreed to stay in her own quarters.",
    "13": "The subject is, in fact, a covert Outland extremist who infiltrated DisCity with the intent to assassinate high-ranking FAC officials and undermine DisCity's security. The attack she initiated during the Great Expo's closing ceremony resulted in significant casualties and widespread destabilization, warranting immediate detention and stringent containment measures.",
    "14": "During the Outland war, the subject was captured by enemy forces during a battlefield sweep. Exposed to Mania from enemy weapons, she awakened to newfound abilities, and with them, a burning vengeance."

    "Criminal Record 1": "The owner of shell company *Whitestone Industries*, the subject engaged in illegal businesses such as debt collection and hired thug recruitment. The subject has indirectly participated in all sorts of violent and illegal activities over a hundred times, causing massive property damage as well as posing an immeasurable threat to the Syndican region's stability.\nThe subject claims to have grown up in Syndicate, but no records concerning the identity *Bai Yi* dated before N.F. 105 can be found, so the subject is suspected to have forged her identity to cover up other crimes.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Although the subject remains sluggish and noncompliant after her arrest, she's ceased all illegal activities, both personal and under the name of Whitestone Industries. Currently, all three members of the company, Bai Yi, K.K., and Che, are stable and happy about their newfound life security and the fact that they don't need to exhaust themselves with work anymore. They show no tendency or possibility of escape.\nIt's confirmed that the subject has no other aliases or criminal records except those that are already on file. The only new discovery is that the subject may be related to *Parma*.",
    "Ability Summary": "The power supports the subject's movement at supersonic speed while maintaining impressive preciseness. Equipped with her sword named *Halo*, the subject can vanquish dozens of enemies within three seconds. Seeing that the record is still being broken constantly, the subject possesses unimaginable potential.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject seems to have awakened years ago, but no available means can accurately deduce the time she first used her power and the reason for her awakening is still unknown.",
    "Corruption State": "Despite the subject's potent power, no Mania symptoms can be detected in her unless through advanced screening and lab analysis. The subject's condition seriously contradicts existing Mania level patterns and its cause is still to be investigated.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject accidentally bumped into the MBCC's patrol while evading debt collectors, injuring several people. Later, a surveillance check suggested that this person showed signs of possessing Sinner power, and the subject was arrested after confirmation.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The database denied the MBCC's request to access the subject's early records, and the subject is unwilling to provide relevant information. There has been no progress on the investigation of the subject's childhood and family background.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "With limited access to the subject's records, it's currently only known that before settling in Syndicate, the subject apparently changed identities frequently to evade an unknown power hunting her down. After settling down in Syndicate, the subject started running *Whitestone Industries* with Che and K.K., taking the role of the company's owner. The company has since been on the verge of bankruptcy multiple times.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject hides her past and her true levels of power under her playful and frivolous appearance. Her real identity, and the mysterious individuals hunting her down when she's after the fake Whitestone Industries require further investigations.",
    "Performance 1": "In stark contrast to her appalling power, the subject is unenthusiastic about all basic job duties and assigned missions and completely lacks the concept of time. There has been no improvement even after repeated warnings.",
    "Performance 2": "Having taken miscellaneous jobs like hired thug, delivery worker, and missing person searcher in the past, the subject is very willing to share her seasoned work experience with other Sinners. But as the subject's sharing often reflects questionable personal values, these chats have been interrupted by staff many times.",
    "Performance 3": "Skilled at making her own drinks with various grains and unknown ingredients, but never sells them and only shares them with other Sinners within a certain range.

Out of compassion and encouragement, Chief has bought a small number of shares. To show her gratitude, the subject has suggested partnership with Chief to bind their interests together.

    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject claims to be the leader of the Syndican gang *the Homeless* and helps other children solve their problems. She offers aid exclusively to children. The Homeless got involved in street fights mostly because the subject wanted to stop human trafficking and violence toward children.\nSince her detention, the subject has appeared less motivated in general. Although she's shown no signs of violence or tendency to escape, further supervision is required.",
    "Ability Summary": "She can use all shadows around her as weapons. Her ability, however, has a strong side effect. It will create great inertia, causing mental fatigue to the user and creating dependence on special powers.",

    "Performance 1": "She resorted to hiding in the shadows many times to dodge all MBCC fieldwork. As a result, the Bureau staff members can be seen looking for the Sinner with flashlights during the day.",
    "Performance 2": "As she lacks interest in everything, the Bureau staff helped her develop her interests and complete her basic education. It did not work out in the end due to reasons such as being caught sleeping under her desk, injuring a teacher or staff member, disappearing in the middle of class.",
    "Performance 3": "The majority of Sinners from Syndicate are aware of Crache's existence and appreciate her capabilities. However, Crache does not care about this and would only refer to the vast majority of Sinners in the Bureau as \"obnoxious adults.\"",
    "Performance 4": "Unlike people of her age, the subject hates sweets, especially lollipops, even if they are given by Chief. \"But I'll think about it if it's hand-made by Chief.\""

She searches for specific targets using a novelty show as a cover and confines them, among other things, without any regard for consequences. This has caused a panic and greatly disrupted the order in Eastside.\nThe subject once took extreme measures to put the Chief of the MBCC in danger in their confrontation. Therefore, the object is regarded by the FAC as a highly dangerous Sinner and must be detained immediately.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Since her detention, regular examinations have found that the subject's stress has reached a dangerous level. The finding can explain her various behaviors prior to her detention. To lower her insecurity and stabilize her mental state, the MBCC conducts desensitization therapy on her in the form of monitored physical contact with other Sinners or Chief when her conditions allow it. So far, this has been effective and her various indicators have been kept within the normal range.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject awakened her power after being infected with Mania and bitten by a snake. When the snake venom combined with the Maniac energies inside her, she became a Sinner with some of the characteristics of snakes. The subject is good at covering her tracks and sensing heat sources, and her blood is toxic—these characteristics make her a great stealthy fighter.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject doesn't know where she got infected with Mania, but remembers being on the brink of death due to a snakebite she sustained as a teenager. She was saved by Mania, which awakened her power and turned her into a Sinner.",
    "Corruption State": "Upon examination, it's found that the subject suffers from a high level of Maniac corruption, but that her mind has not been affected significantly. No Mania Crystals have been found on her body, but her teeth, ears, eyes, and skin have taken on a snake-like characteristic.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "When Chief is on a mission in Eastside, Serpent gets in the way of and tries to provoke Chief. After Chief has solved everything, Serpent owns up to the crimes she has committed, and voluntarily agrees to be detained, though it is not clear if she has an ulterior motive.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Serpent's origin is a mystery. She's registered as an orphan from Eastside by Phantom Entertainment. But further investigations show that she's closely linked to the Pet Snake Incident, the Disappearance of Phantom Entertainment Guests, and other strange cases.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "A family of four from a villa neighborhood in Eastside has gone missing mysteriously. According to info on the internet and testimonies of the family's neighbors, the family kept a python as a pet, which was taken care of by a girl. The girl and the snake has also gone missing.\nThrough a comparison of different sources of information, it's confirmed that the girl is Sinner Serpent.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "A recheck on all the information concerning Serpent turns up something bewildering about her, like where she attained the Bottle of Dreams. The MBCC is convinced that some person or people put Serpent up to it, and decides to dig deeper into her background.",
    "Performance 1": "The MBCC tried to detain Serpent and her snake in separate places, but the snake becomes agitated and restless in its cage, posing a threat to the lives of the staffers. Therefore the MBCC had to return the snake to Serpent's side.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject is very demanding about the temperature and humidity of living quarters. She demands a constant temperature, or she will not cooperate in any operations. Once, on a hot summer day, the subject stripped off every piece of clothing, let her snake cover up the private parts, and carried out a protest, to express her dissatisfaction.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject retains some habits she acquired as a performer with Phantom Entertainment, which help her build fairly amicable relationships in the MBCC. But when the subject perceives sarcasm or threat in the interlocutor's remarks, she tends to overreact. Some staffers said they felt their lives were under threat, and only a few Sinners find the way Serpent reacts quite amusing.",
    "Performance 4": "Once, while talking with Chief, the subject used her snake to bind her feet and Chief's together to stop Chief from leaving the room. When questioned, the subject claimed that she just wanted a warmer to put under her blanket."

    "Criminal Record 1": "An Eastside hairdresser as well as the subject of the *Fog Alley* urban legend. Appearing mostly in the dark alley at night, she's been accused of multiple crimes including attacking residents and obscuring their memories.\nDue to the nature of her ability, her victims' accounts are often dismissed as fiction. Incomplete research shows that she's victimized close to a hundred people.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "With Chief's help, the subject has regained partial memories about the Fog Alley case. When her identity was exposed, she often severed all relationships and moved to a new place. It's believed that she aspires to the mundanity of daily life to compensate for the lack of close relationships. Through interactions with Chief, she gradually recognizes the MBCC as her new base and no longer provides her previous extreme services.",
    "Ability Summary": "Her ability can interfere with others' minds and perception of the past. So far, the recorded direct effect is influencing or altering memories. The duration and effect of the ability depends on the subject's condition.\nBesides causing mental influence, her shears, made of a material stronger than regular metals, can also deal physical damage.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The reason and exact time of power awakening is unknown. The nature of her ability severely hinders the investigation, but judging from the timeline of the spread of the Fog Alley legend, she must have already awakened for some time.",
    "Corruption State": "Although her physical appearance is normal, her physical abilities are actually far superior to those of ordinary people. It's not immediately apparent, but the subject has long been plagued by hallucinations and her memories show signs of self-interference.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "During the Fog Alley case, the subject fled after severing all the witnesses' memories about her. She then repeatedly escaped the FAC's arrests and was eventually captured by Chief and brought back to the MBCC.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject has repeatedly altered others' and her own memories, which seriously impacts her own mental state. It's currently impossible to verify if her obsession with the mundanity of daily life is linked to her past experiences.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The investigation shows that the subject lived with her mother since childhood, shouldering most daily chores and tolerating her mothers' negative emotions constantly. Her past with her mother could be key to her awakening.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "For her mother's happiness, the subject trimmed off both her and her mother's memories of each other. In the following years, she *served* her clients with her ability by cutting away their trouble-inducing memories until she was found out. She kept moving homes to protect her daily life, unintentionally spreading the urban legend surrounding her.",
    "Performance 1": "Though she hasn't shown particular interest in things other than serving clients, she often keeps flowers and fragrances in her cell, calling it *a trick to mask the smell of hair spray*.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject's highly likable character makes the Sinners and staff lower their guard and open up to her easily. After two attack attempts, the MBCC decided to hold an internal seminar to promote the importance of privacy. In response, Adela claimed that she was only trying to help them.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject has transformed her cell into a vintage-style hair salon where she provides various services to the Sinners in the Bureau. Rumor has it that she can produce anything from her counter, and many like to test that theory for fun. But this service has soon been restricted ever since she took out a forbidden weapon from her counter.",
    "Performance 4": "She invites Chief to an afternoon tea every week and always prepares ample treats beforehand. This is the only occasion that she insists Chief come alone as she prefers not to be disturbed by other Sinners. \"Being by Chief's side is the mundane routine I dream of.\""

Currently, she is shackled in the containment room by the MBCC Chief, waiting to undergo psychic diving.",
    "Performance 2": "After the completion of the psychic diving, the subject has been placed in the containment room for long-term observation. She appears to maintain a strong sense of curiosity and goodwill. However, severe Mania contamination and other unknown factors cause adverse physical mutations in humans around her. Therefore, contact with her should be avoided by anyone other than the Chief.",
    "Performance 3": "Due to her physiological structure, the subject has retained some insect habits. Her senses are extremely sharp, capable of hearing sounds from several rooms away. The subject seems to have a certain desire to express herself and attempts to communicate with other individuals. However, apart from the Chief, no one can understand what she is trying to express.",

Later, she escorted Chief to rejoin the MBCC's crew and secretly helped eliminate a large number of residual gangsters.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Highly tolerant of chaotic environments, the subject lacks a sense of cleanliness which leads to her dwelling's floors being so cluttered there's not even space to walk on. The subject doesn't have a saving habit, and only accepts orders on the dark web when she runs out of money. Unless required by a job, the subject does not actively follow any external news, leading an almost static, isolated life.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Affected by her special power, the subject's senses are overly sharp, hence she usually needs to wear headphones and play music to block out noise in order to sleep. The subject also listens to music during outdoor activities or combat to shield herself from external disturbances so that she can focus.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject's apparent indifference stems from a clear understanding of herself and reality. Since being pulled into the shadows of the dark web as a contractor, the subject has realized she can no longer return to normal social life. She has accepted her life as an outcast in the dark and carved out her own path, always guarding what she's determined to protect in her own way.",

    "Performance 2": "The subject cherishes her blade, regularly cleaning and maintaining it. She practices swinging it every day without fail. The blade is always with her and she considers it as an extension of her body, even keeping it by her side while sleeping.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject's many legendary deeds had already spread among the Sinners upon her arrival at the MBCC. Her unassuming, solitary, and taciturn nature gives her an attractive and mysterious air. Her *self-reliant and aloof* demeanor has once attracted the admiration and emulation of many younger Sinners.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject rarely initiates contact with others, but Chief is an exception. After leaving the MBCC, she invites Chief to her safe house periodically. Chief always honors the invitations regardless of the amount of work at hand, bringing along heaps of fresh ingredients and cleaning supplies."

    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject first appeared around the time Top Hitman Angell kidnapped the Chief. Her identity and past are unknown, and she mainly operates via the Internet. After detecting the subject's connection to the dark web incidents, the MBCC detained her.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Investigations indicate that the subject lost her parents early in life and was taken in by the \"Noir\" organization, which exploited her hacking skills for profit. After coming of age, she chose to leave Noir, but they processed the software she left behind into a malicious virus, which continues to spread on the dark web.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "In July N.F. 114, the remnants of Noir were completely subdued by the MBCC. However, both the Chief and the subject went missing after the operation.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "With the subject's help, all individuals involved in the dark web incidents were captured, and all virus files were found and destroyed. Henceforth, the subject will continue to provide technical support to the MBCC as an external aid.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject enjoys pranks, often hacking into the Bureau's system or uploading her photos to everyone's desktops. Given that her actions haven't caused significant harm, only minimal surveillance is currently maintained.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject is keen on socializing and likes to attend Sinners' video game parties. However, due to her advanced skills, the other Sinners complain that she cheats and banned her from further participation.",
    "Performance 3": "Thanks to her exceptional hacking skills, she helps solve difficult problems for the tech department from time to time. However, as one employee mentioned, she always adjusts the UI to maximum brightness, blinding others.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject proposed holding regular firework shows and invited Chief to join her in igniting her massive DIY fireworks. Given the danger of her customized fireworks, the Bureau declined her proposal. The invitation was modified to a viewing from a distance."

    "Incident": "Morveth Castle Incident",
    "Criminal Record 1": "Wearing a tattered, soiled wedding dress, the subject wanders the abandoned Morveth Castle and is dubbed the *Ghost Bride*. Her presence is highly destabilizing and she demonstrates bizarre behavior, mental instability, as well as an extreme obsession with weddings and vows.\nAfter Morveth Castle was abandoned, spirits gathered there, giving rise to a legend that making wishes here could reconnect one with the dead, attracting many gullible visitors. Immediate detention of the subject is recommended to prevent the legend from escalating and to curb further Mania contamination.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Investigation reveals that the subject is innocent and kind-hearted by nature, and has never used her special power to harm others. According to her own account, someone left a ring in the castle, which she picked up. Under the ring's influence, she made a wish and accidentally summoned Chief to the location.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject possesses highly dangerous neural control capabilities, able to hijack and distort the target's perceptions. Her special power can deprive sensory abilities and thus self-control of the target.

    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject was born into a regular family in a small town on the outskirts of Syndicate. Contaminated with Mania from birth, she was abandoned by her fearful parents at a church in another town. After being taken in by Sister Elsie, the subject became part of the church community, but her life was never happy, as she remained feared by others and grew up in isolation.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "As the only church in the town, all weddings and funerals were held there. Weddings became the only source of solace for the subject. She learned a lot about weddings and was gifted an old wedding dress that had lost its owner. However, as more and more residents left and the nun passed away, the church was eventually abandoned.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "With nowhere else to go, the subject could only wander the dilapidated castle in her wedding dress, accompanied only by spirits. Day after day, the forgotten castle gradually became known as the rumored *posthumous wedding hall* and the subject became the legendary *Ghost Bride*.",
    "Performance 1": "She knows everything, down to the most obscure trivia, when it comes to weddings. Familiar even with Outland marriage customs, she is certainly qualified as a wedding officiant, though unfortunately she has never had the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject's whereabouts are unpredictable. She likes wandering aimlessly in pitch-dark places, often scaring people unintentionally. However, contrary to the *Ghost Bride* legend surrounding her, she is surprisingly timid herself and has trouble sleeping every time she watches a horror film.",
    "Performance 3": "Having only lived in the church before coming to the Bureau, the subject has many misconceptions about various aspects of life. Since her arrival, she seems at times awed or frightened by all modern electronic devices. For example, she's reluctant to use a communication device or be captured by the surveillance cameras, and she seems reverent toward microwave ovens.",
    "Performance 4": "Romance-related holidays are particularly important to her. She often sends handwritten, wax-sealed letters inviting Chief to *go and make vows together at some wishing stone* or *put a love lock bearing both their names on some bridge*. Though Chief does not fully comprehend these rituals, the invitations are occasionally accepted when the schedule permits."

    "Criminal Record 1": "Suspected to be a dangerous scientist spy with some anti-EDGE tendency. Once praised as an extremely rare genius, the subject was the Ring Research Institute's youngest member. The subject was exposed for owning the core technology of a classified forbidden weapon without permission. She refused the institute's collaboration request and betrayed the institute.\nThe subject's behaviors directly led to the leak of Ring Weapon technology into the market and facilitated the creation of Mania Weapons, greatly worsening the violence in Syndicate.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "It's now been proven that the Research Institute violated the regulations early on and sold Ring Weapon-related technology to Parma. The contamination-loaded Mania weapons available in the market are products of Parma's evil research.\nIt's confirmed that the subject has invented a contamination-free Ring Weapon. Her invention has improved the lives of many and she provides essential support behind various major missions of the Bureau.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject has lower-than-average physical health statistics but her intelligence far exceeds the mean, the upper limit of her IQ indeterminable by any currently available tests. Uses a personally developed drone-like Ring Weapon to aid fights.",
    "Awakening Signs": "As reported by the Ring Research Institute, the subject carried out multiple unauthorized experiments during her tenure in the institute and purposely approached sources of contamination. It's believed that the accumulation of contaminants in her body reached a breaking point and triggered the awakening.",
    "Corruption State": "Relies too much on the Ring Weapon to move around, leading to muscle degeneration and a weaker body. But the growth of her Mania level is significantly lower than that in normal people, so it's believed that the subject was born with higher compatibility with the Ring Substance.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "Following an order from the top, the MBCC spent a long time tracking and observing the subject and finally arrested her when she attended her graduation ceremony while still injured. The subject had prepared close to ten escape plans but still ended up being captured by Chief personally.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Born in an Eastside family with a scientific and engineering background, the subject has demonstrated incredible intelligence and a gift for mechanical engineering since a young age. At fourteen, the subject had already mastered all doctoral courses and was exceptionally accepted into the Ring Research Institute by recommendation as a junior high school student, making headlines in Eastside.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "As one of the youngest researchers in the Ring Research Institute, Summer picked Ring Weapon as her research topic and quickly achieved monumental breakthroughs in the field. The research was then suspended for some unknown reason, while the subject was transferred to *Project Genius* by the institute.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The institute passed the Ring Weapon to the Laboratory of Parma without Summer's agreement. She was enraged by this action and subsequently dug out the truth about the human experiments. After destroying the Parma lab, the subject escaped with the research result. She was charged with multiple crimes by the 9th Agency and included on the wanted list.",
    "Performance 1": "Everything the subject owns has been highly customized by herself: a computer that follows her around, a hovering platform that carries her everywhere, the detention room that's been immediately modified into a lab... Even her utensils are equipped with an artificial intelligence speech recognition system.",
    "Performance 2": "Overly obsessed with the idea of a *free and fun high school life*. The complex and unusual personnel in the MBCC have never been able to satisfy her fantasy. She once attempted to create forty android classmates to be her companions but was stopped by the staff.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject has been specially allowed to visit her family. It's been observed that Summer is able to effectively hold back her uninhibited behavior a couple days before and after her parents' visits.",
    "Performance 4": "Has been strictly demanded by Chief to swear off her Ring Weapon dependence and to train herself physically and walk with her feet. Summer has been following the training schedule very listlessly, keeping a record of four sit-ups in a minute. This is possibly the maximum compromise she's made in order to make Chief stay and watch anime with her."

    "Criminal Record 2": "According to meticulously gathered information and the analysis of Chief's conversations with her, the subject is in fact extremely loyal to DisCity.

    "Criminal Record 1": "Oak Casket is an underground information broker who uses Romanesque Hall as a front. She commits brutal murders, and sells classified information she has collected to violent gangs, which has brought about many large conflicts resulting in heavy casualties; she also disrupts the balance of power in Syndicate by using confidential information to stir up frictions between the various factions in the region.\nSeveral cases of trafficking are also linked to Oak Casket. It's unclear where she obtained the trafficked products (later on, by her own admission, she obtained some of the products herself). This is a serious crime that has disastrous ramifications; she must be detained immediately.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "For a long time, the subject was active in Syndicate as *the only hall manager who could hold a funeral in Syndicate* and made a living with her ability to obtain information from Corruptor remains. But judging from her behavior after her arrest, she seems to have long tired of life around gangsters and looks forward to a change.\nCurrently, the subject's conduct in the Bureau is satisfactory. Although she still has an avid interest in death and remains, her obsession is overall still under control.",
    "Ability Summary": "Oak Casket's power allows her to capture and decode the information that is carried in the electric field and magnetic field created by a newly-dead Maniac's brain and body. How much information she can attain is inversely proportional to how long the person has been dead.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Oak Casket was infected with Mania and awakened her power in a mass grave somewhere in Syndicate when she was a teenager; she was badly injured, but miraculously survived. As a Sinner, she has the ability to heal her body to a certain degree without any external help, and to attain useful information from newly-dead Maniacs.",
    "Corruption State": "The test results show that Oak Casket suffers from a moderate level of Maniac corruption. No abnormalities have been found on her body, but when her mind is exposed to certain types of stimulation, she will hallucinate and exhibit other symptoms.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The Chief meets Oak Casket in Syndicate during a rescue mission. The Chief first clashes with and then works with her, and at the end of the mission, she goes to the MBCC with the Chief of her own volition, and agrees to be detained.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Born during the most chaotic period in Syndicate, the subject was adopted by a kind soul at a rescue station and lived with several other children. This rescue station would later become the Romanesque Hall. During this time, because of her introverted personality, she was regarded as an oddity by those around her.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "At around thirteen, the rescue station was besieged due to involvement in gang-related incidents, and the subject was seriously injured in the assault. Barely clinging to life, she was abandoned by her benefactor. From then on, she awakened as a Sinner.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Investigations reveal that after being abandoned, the subject became disillusioned with the chaotic situation in Syndicate, believing that there was no hope in the world. After resolving her obsessions with Chief, her perspective changed, and she held a funeral for her past self.",
    "Performance 1": "In the early days of her detention, Oak Casket is passive and cold, with vital signs once being abnormally low. She is then diagnosed with *information input disruption syndrome*, which manifests itself as a passiveness arising from an inability to adjust to a normal environment after a long period of residing in an abnormal environment.",
    "Performance 2": "After a period of adjustment, Oak Casket starts getting accustomed to her life in detention. She is still passive and cold, and is not performing as well as she should be in battles, but has a tremendous fighting spirit. The MBCC later decides to let Chief include her in as many battles as possible, so as to satisfy her need of extracting information from the newly dead.",
    "Performance 3": "To further alleviate Oak Casket's passiveness, the MBCC agrees to move her to the room next to Dudu's, and replace the bed in the room with a long, black oak casket. She is doing well at the moment, on the road to recovery, and starts to get along with the other Sinners.",
    "Performance 4": "Oak Casket's symptoms have been improving thanks to the comforting of Chief and Dudu, and she is returning to the physical status she was in back when she was in Syndicate. She is becoming more trusting of Chief, and more willingly to protect Chief in battles; she is not as obsessed as before with seeing those around her dead so that she can extract information from them."

    "Arrest Records 1": "After the subject was detained near DisSea under the Illusory Moon, she was placed in confinement for observation and treatment. Since it was impossible to communicate with her using normal means, the MBCC was instructed that Chief would personally reach out to her via dreams.",

Probably due to severe mental corrosion, she exhibited hallucinatory and rambling behavior. However, with the help of her companions, and her own will to survive, the subject seemed to have retained a certain level of human consciousness, enabling those who came later to awaken her.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Ever since witnessing the fall of the Perishing Star and experiencing the Apocalypse as a child, the subject has had a strong passion for both the truth and the unknown.

    "Performance 2": "After completing the Mirage dive, the subject has been put back in her cell for further observation. According to observation records, the subject does not show any movements except for breathing motions. Only when Chief appears does she engage in certain actions and dialogue.",
    "Performance 3": "Because she had a strong interest in astronomy and the Perishing Star before getting completely corrupted by contamination, the subject is infatuated with the night sky. She tries her best to ask Chief to take her to observe celestial bodies and acquire astronomical knowledge.",
    "Performance 4": "Based on information obtained by the Mirage dive, the subject had been a researcher at a certain research institute before getting completely corrupted by contamination. During the Black Ring Expedition, she insisted on carrying with her six cans of mixed fruit."

    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject planned to build a school in Syndicate, but the project was met with practical obstacles.

Although the incident did not cause any casualties or financial losses, the subject was still detained by the Chief of the MBCC.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Since the MBCC took over the Syndicate Academy construction project, the subject has been working hard to recruit students and compile the curriculum. However, she is dissatisfied with the history of Syndicate recounted by Eastside and wishes to rewrite it.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject fought alongside Rustfire in N.F. 103 and returned to Eastside in the same year to publicize Rustfire's achievements.

    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject is currently an instructor at Syndicate Academy who mainly teaches the Disian language and poetry. According to her, the teaching staff now comprises 15 people, and the number of students has also reached 136. If all goes well, the school will continue expanding in scale.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject has an eccentric personality, behaves in an erratic and unconventional manner, always makes exaggerated physical movements and expressions of emotion.

Since arriving at the MBCC, the subject has written an entire notebook of hymns, and she is looking for the right moment to recite them all to Chief in front of all Sinners and staffs in one sitting."

As a result, it was determined that she needed to be detained immediately.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "After a personal investigation by the Chief, it was determined that the Mania overflow incident happened because she was affected by Mania while under immense mental pressure from others. She had no real intention of harming others and is actively undergoing mental treatment.",
    "Ability Summary": "Her special power is generated by her mind, amplified and spread through modern sensors like mobile phones, affecting the minds of the recipients.

    "Arrest Records 4": "At her request, the Eastside TV station's program Call at 3 AM will be permanently canceled, and Eleven will be removed from the TV station. However, the TV station allowed her to record a final farewell program. The farewell program was a departure from her usual style, with witty and aggressive commentary. As a result, it once again became a top search keyword and spawned a completely different late-night radio program specifically for the new her.",
    "Performance 1": "As a former late-night radio host, she initially had trouble adjusting to the Bureau's schedule, often staying awake at night. Given the nature of her unique voice, strange tales regarding \"voices\" soon started spreading around the Bureau.",

    "Performance 4": "She has an inexplicable obsession with Chief's working hours. If Chief works beyond the usual time, she will provide gentle reminders. However, most of the time, her reminders are of little use, and Chief often receives a call from her at 3 AM."

    "Performance 4": "The subject is visually impaired but has exceptionally keen hearing. She is sensitive to all unfamiliar sounds in the detention room, which may cause her to panic and lose control. Only Chief's presence induces calm and positive emotions in her."

    "Criminal Record 1": "The subject is the founder and de facto governor of Désir, an Outland immigrant town situated outside DisCity. She also leads a clandestine commercial organization operating along DisCity's borders, wielding considerable influence throughout WhiteSands and the border areas. Despite her mysterious background, she maintains a widespread reputation.\nAs the head of this organization, the subject's frequent activities along the borders pose a severe security threat to DisCity. Given their adverse impact, immediate detention is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Interrogation reveals that the subject's past experiences have shaped her as a pessimist, who firmly believes in the inevitability of tragedy and the immutability of the future. Given that, she dedicated herself to protecting dreams that were doomed to shatter, which ultimately precipitates into the Désir incident. Following Chief's intervention and sharing of personal stories, her fatalistic attitude began to soften. She later made a deal with Chief, voluntarily accepting the shackles in exchange for a more promising future. Her threat level has since decreased, her merchant caravan now a valuable trade partner to the Bureau.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject is able to capture and store others' disillusionment—an invisible substance akin to a compound of spiritual energy. Through specific mediums, she can manipulate these accumulated illusions and convert them into physically destructive force of detrimental magnitude.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Frequent exposure to disasters in her hometown left the subject with latent Mania contamination. While trading in WhiteSands, she seemed to have formed a certain kind of contract with a mysterious power in the region, awakening her special power.",
    "Corruption State": "Awakened during the latent period, she shows no physical signs of mutation. She dreams frequently, mostly peaceful and pleasant ones.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "Throughout the Désir incident, the subject maintained an ambiguous stance, refraining from choosing a side. Her true thoughts regarding Désir and its residents also remained inscrutable. She monitored Chief during this period yet did not actively impede investigation. Their relationship evolved into a lasting partnership over time.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "After the resolution of the Désir incident, the subject's whereabouts became unknown. She is believed to have resumed her trade in WhiteSands, with her current location traceable only through the gifts and letters she regularly sends to the Bureau. This indicates that the subject sustained minimal losses during the incident and maintained her extensive resources and business network.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Born as named Madeleine, the subject hailed from a wealthy merchant family in an Outland city. Her privileged upbringing distanced her from commerce, but a series of disasters left her family in desperate straits. Assuming the alias Vautour Bleu, she led her surviving relatives on a perilous journey to DisCity, which unfortunately claimed the lives of all her loved families before her arrival.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject arrived in DisCity only to be met with equally bleak conditions, leading to her complete disillusionment with the DisCity dream. Having lived through the trauma herself, she chose to conceal the truth and deceive the townspeople, taking them under her wing with various methods, such as the datura pollen.",
    "Performance 1": "She maintains a leisurely daily routine and particularly enjoys sunbathing during lunch breaks. She has adapted well to the simulated sunlight in both the outdoor activity area and the greenhouse. Her half-dozing pose has quickly become a familiar sight at the Bureau. When a mischievous Sinner attempted to prank her during her nap, it became immediately apparent that she was not defenseless even in repose.",
    "Performance 2": "Sophisticated and knowledgeable, the subject knows well WhiteSands specialties and the Eastside upper class. Her repertoire of insider stories and gossip has earned her popularity among Sinners. She'd also willingly exchange these plausible tales for small favors, such as dessert delivery from the cafeteria.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject's approachable demeanor and accommodating personality prove highly charismatic, quickly attracting a group of Sinners who eagerly attend to her every need. Furthermore, her extensive network of connections enables uninterrupted external contact and management of affairs outside the Bureau despite her detention, garnering additional attention from Sinners seeking to leverage her influence.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject invited Chief to an afternoon tea and specifically prepared a type of traditional seashell-shaped cake from Outland freshly baked by a top pastry chef in Eastside. Not well-versed in confectionery, Chief only learned the name of these delicate, airy pastries after tasting them."

    "Criminal Record 1": "The Wisteria Fairy who's lived over a thousand years, documented in Eastian legends. Every New Year, she holds a fete to grant blessings, attracting numerous devotees who come to make wishes. However, rumors also claim the subject is a spirit transformed from a millennium-old wisteria tree that drains people's Qi and eventually their lives, and that none who attend her fete ever return alive.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject is a survivor of the Perishing Star's fall in N.F. 01. The collective dying memories and intense survival instincts of thousands at the fete merged with her, awakening her as a Sinner. For a century, whenever the fete reappeared, she always sacrificed her power and life energy to appease restless spirits and protect visitors caught within. After a chance encounter with Chief, and thanks to Chief's persistence, the subject, despite being severely corrupted by Mania, gained a sliver of hope for revival after the fete subsided. According to her, Chief embodies her purpose and hope for a new life, and she wishes to remain by Chief's side forever.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can use a wisteria flower staff to manifest a blooming wisteria tree. Its fragrance and branches can dominate the minds of her prey, draining their mental energy and consciousness to serve as *nutrients* that nourish her power.",
    "Awakening Signs": "In N.F. 01, the Perishing Star fell, triggering widespread disasters that struck a small town. Beneath the wisteria tree of this town, the subject endured both Mania contamination and physical devastation from the calamity. Overwhelmed by the power of the townspeople's wishes, she awakened her special power, becoming a Sinner and shouldering the survival desires of the entire town. From then on, she sustained her power and illusion by absorbing the Qi and consciousness of the living.",
    "Corruption State": "Severely corrupted, her physical body remains inseparable from the Mania contaminants.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "After the wisteria Mania was defeated, the century-old fete illusion was dispelled. The Sinner's physical body, having suffered severe corruption, could not be detached from the Mania remains. After days of continuous searching, Chief finally was able to connect with her spiritually through a new sprout at the bottom of the ruins.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject's recovery has seen little to slow progress, requiring generous Qi transfers from Chief to maintain minimal improvement. Upon realizing this process would seriously endanger Chief's health, the subject has become very reluctant to consider her own revival, refusing further spiritual contact with Chief.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Recently, an Eastian delegation has visited the Bureau. Claiming to be descendants from the subject's homeland and having learned of her stalled recovery, they've proposed to bring her back to her origin to facilitate her recuperation. After thorough verification, it's confirmed that the delegation members have deep historical connections to the original location of the wisteria fete. The delegation has demonstrated their sincerity and offered multiple guarantees for the subject's well-being. Their proposal is currently being carefully considered.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Of her own volition, the subject has declined the Eastians' proposal to bring her back to her homeland, choosing instead to remain in DisCity under Chief and the Bureau's care. Currently, the Bureau has already agreed to provide the Eastian representatives with regular remote communication and convenient visitation channels, ensuring unobstructed contact between the two sides.",
    "Performance 1": "During the early days of detention, due to her extremely fragile condition, constant supervision was required. However, records indicated that the staff responsible for her care were significantly more likely to be late the next day. When questioned, the staff all claimed the cause was unknown, merely stating it was hard to get out of bed due to the pleasant dreams they recently experienced. Upon learning of this situation, Chief decided to personally take care of her in order not to jeopardize the Bureau's attendance rates.",
    "Performance 2": "Recently, Chief has received numerous reports of paranormal phenomena, including but not limited to unexplained floral fragrance and incidents of people being struck on the head by random falling wisteria blossoms. Some staff have even reported sightings of an indistinct figure humming foreign melodies on the trees of the Outdoor Activity Area. So far, Chief has not taken any measures regarding these reports, merely instructing everyone to remain calm and not be too concerned.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject is naturally drawn to lively environments. Having been stuck in the fete illusion for a century, she always maintains a profound interest and curiosity toward all things and people. She often listens attentively to other Sinners discussing various topics and enjoys the atmosphere of everyone gathering together to chat and laugh.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject has meticulously crafted two wisteria bracelets for Chief. One features perpetually blooming wisteria, symbolizing everlasting affection. The other remains dormant and silent, only unfurling when the subject is nearby. She claims that the fragrance will remind Chief of her, so Chief won't forget to meet her every day."

This was a crucial trigger that provoked the Eastsiders' objections to Sinners and the FAC to send the MBCC to arrest all Sinners.",

    "Arrest Records 1": "The Chief was commissioned to go to the endless carnival and suppress BR-001 Black Ring, and in the process successfully arrested Hamel, the first Sinner who revealed the identity of a Sinner. Since the subject is trapped in the illusion for many years, she was immediately taken in and provided psychiatric treatment after contamination from the Black Ring was removed.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "Parents are working as agents to train the subject to become a famous dancer. Tired of the over-frequent commercial events, the subject has a poor relationship with both parents and is closer to her brother, Norman. After the siblings ran away, the parents disappeared with the money to escape debts.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject got famous with just one dance at the age of sixteen, and rose to the commercial and artistic peak in DisCity with the help of parents and talent. Escaped with younger brother, Norman, due to stage fright, but reappeared a few years later in the endless carnival event.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The investigation found that the BR-001 Black Ring inventor was someone else. The subject sacrificed personal freedom to confine the Corruptors and suppress the Black Ring after finding out the anomalies in the endless carnival, which effectively stopped the spread of the danger. Convicted of collective disappearance by the FAC, but it is still debatable whether the subject is guilty of committing a crime.",
    "Performance 1": "Lacks the concept of time due to being trapped in illusions for over a decade. The youthful state of the personality and body have been kept by unknown influences. Extremely uncomfortable with real life. Often found zoning out and unresponsive to external stimuli.",
    "Performance 2": "The dance costume has the same design as the one the subject wore in the last performance. The material test showed that she was wearing a silk nightgown at home, and what the people saw was an illusion created by her special power.",
    "Performance 3": "Being the \"first recognized Sinner,\" the MBCC was worried that she would be ostracized, but instead, people crowded around Hamel's room, wanting to see the legendary dancer.",
    "Performance 4": "Hamel can communicate with Chief smoothly now. The two are said to often dance together in the cell to communicate. Chief's act of appreciating artistic treasure exclusively without sharing has been strongly condemned."

This incident influences Enfer's early works, and is the inspiration behind Enfer's series of horror-themed sculptures.",

    "Performance 4": "It seems that Enfer has a special attachment to Chief. She makes a sculpture for Chief. It is a sculpture that conveys a sense of warmth and beauty; this is a huge departure from her usual style, which is steeped in morbidity and horror."

    "Arrest Records 2": "Due to her pickiness towards ingredients and her noble status, the subject has become a major figure in Eastside who can alter the trend of the dining world. This has led to an unwritten rule in Eastside—only chefs who have the subject's approval can establish themselves there. As a result, many people are willing to risk their lives to present rare ingredients to the subject, in hopes of gaining her approval.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "After investigating the subject, it was found that there was a room in her mansion that could accommodate ten people to store her \"ingredients,\" including but not limited to the two who caused the Insatiable Fiesta. Among these victims, Carley and Greg were the most seriously affected. After being medically examined, the rest of the victims were not in fatal condition and were escorted home. However, due to the subject's power and her status as a Sinner, no news of this event has leaked out.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject noticed that when humans get angry and reproach others to protect what they love, their souls are likely to glow and taste delicious. Therefore, the subject admitted that for a while after her awakening, she would deliberately design events to provoke the anger of her target to \"cultivate\" their soul.",

    "Performance 3": "Even though the subject holds a prominent status, she gets along well with others and even overly indulges the people she likes. But due to the subject's excessive indulgence, many Sinners stop liking the things they once loved.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject once insisted that Chief must accompany her during meals, otherwise she would refuse to eat. However, thanks to the efforts of Chief and the Bureau, the subject has now learned to dine without Chief's presence."

She exposed her tracks during a mission against Paradeisos officials, and is listed as a priority for detainment due to the highly destabilizing impact of her actions.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The Garden exists in name only, as the subject ceased her activities as an assassin after being detained. Currently, she is committed to the MBCC, working with the Bureau in detaining Sinners. Moreover, investigations revealed that the Garden's catalyst in creating Sinners was the doing of the previous Mentor, not Coquelic. According to performance records, the subject's emotions are stable, and she rarely uses her power.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can turn her mental energy into a Mania Flower and attach it to a target to control, attack, or heal. She can also gift this red flower to others, allowing them to gain the mental energy of the flower's attached target.",

    "Arrest Records 1": "She was commissioned to launch targeted attacks on Paradeisos officials and the FAC. After the attack failed, she faked the destruction of the organization, led the remnants of the Garden to hide their identities, and took refuge in Syndicate.

    "Arrest Records 4": "According to the subject, she seized the position of \"Mentor\" because she could not agree with the Garden's ethos. Under Coquelic's leadership, the Garden became a neutral organization independent from the Underground, and took on various deals while adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards the Sinners under its control.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject claims to be physically weak and requires assistance with everything in life, including but not limited to eating, bathing, and going out.

    "Performance 4": "She often refers to the members of the Garden as \"little flowers,\" and recently, has also begun to refer to the Chief that way. She's also carefully selecting flowers that could symbolize the Chief, planning to plant them in her own flower bed."

As the sole survivor, Eve couldn't let go of the memories. She was talked into staying in the factory and constructed a toy ward with her special power.",

    "Performance 2": "She was initially reclusive and introverted, seldom communicating with others.

    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject's extreme behavior can largely be attributed to her inability to connect with the outside world, which can in turn be attributed to her illness and the impact of being abandoned by her parents at an early age. The subject's actions are not malicious, but stem from a deep-seated longing for stable connections with others and a yearning for freedom. She is currently being guided by Chief to engage with the real world and improve her understanding of it, and she has started making friends offline.",

Investigations reveal that these data signals range from high-quality to junk in quality.",

This genetic disease causes full-body muscle pain and weakness which can only be alleviated by soaking constantly in water. With Chief's shackles, she can come out of the water and walk freely for a short time, though her skin must be kept moist. Research indicates that a complete cure is impossible.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Since her earliest memory, the subject has never left the bathtub at home. Her early understanding of the outside world came entirely from her parents. Initially attentive, the subject's parents grew weary over time and bought her a computer to keep her occupied and avoid conversations with her.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Upon acquiring the computer, the subject became addicted to the online world. However, her condition prevented her from forming lasting connections with people.

    "Performance 3": "In the subject's early days at the Bureau, her inability to converse directly with other Sinners and her dependence on her computer brought her great inconvenience. Later, Sinner Eleven lent her an old personal device so the subject could communicate through typing, which got her through the transition period.",
    "Performance 4": "Perhaps because Chief's shackles allow her to come out of water, the subject frequently visits Chief's office for a chat or asks the Chief to take her out. Her behavior disrupts Chief's daily work to a certain extent."

    "Criminal Record 1": "The subject identifies herself as \"Parfait Medici\" and holds the positions of Executive Director and Investment Advisor at Tulip Holdings, an Eastside-based investment firm. Renowned for her consistently accurate predictions of financial market trends, she earned the moniker \"Investment Guru\" within Eastside's investment circles.\nBeginning in mid-N.F. 115, doubts emerged regarding the legitimacy of her identity. She has since faced allegations of involvement in multiple economic crimes, including the fabrication of an Outland Hypercube mine that has led to substantial economic losses and widespread social repercussions.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject has not utilized her Sinner abilities for a considerable time. Upon investigation, no significant fraudulent activities were uncovered within her venture capital firm. The counterfeiting case from her past has been resolved. Given the minor sum involved and her early provision of substantial compensation to the affected parties, no additional charges were pursued. Presently, the subject remains active in Eastside's financial industry and continues to be in high demand among financial professionals and affluent business figures.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject has the ability to manifest others' trust in physical form. Once she earns their confidence, she can convert that belief into tangible objects, including but not limited to currency and goods. However, should this trust be lost, the materialized items will vanish accordingly.",
    "Awakening Signs": "During the years the subject has been active in Eastside, she has never publicly used her abilities. However, investigations indicate that her powers had already awakened by the time she first appeared at Eastside social events under the \"Parfait Medici\" identity.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject's Mania corruption level is relatively mild, showing no obvious surface infection symptoms and retaining clear mental faculties. However, the subject exhibits abnormally high levels of social activity in daily life, which is suspected to be a side effect of her Sinner abilities.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject experienced a credibility crisis following a series of events in May N.F. 115 and subsequently avoided public appearances in Eastside for the next six months. As her reputation deteriorated, she was revealed to be under suspicion for involvement in a counterfeiting case that had taken place years earlier in Eastside. As a result, she became a wanted individual by both Nirvana and the Financial Inspection Team, leading to her eventual detention by the Chief personally during a field operation.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject claimed to be an \"orphan of the Medici family\" who had been living abroad for years. Her debut at Eastside social events instantly attracted widespread attention. Through a series of high-risk financial ventures, she secured substantial profits for numerous investors. After amassing significant wealth, the subject became a frequent presence at art exhibitions, earning acclaim for her discerning taste and generous patronage of artists, eventually being hailed as a \"model aristocrat.\"",
    "Arrest Records 3": "According to investigations, the subject actually originated from Syndicate and possesses no noble bloodline whatsoever. Her startup capital consisted of counterfeit money created using her Sinner abilities. Because it was completely identical to genuine currency, it temporarily caused market panic. However, the actual amount of counterfeit money she produced was only around 110,000 DisCoins.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "At the N.F. 115-116 Spring Concert, the Eastside investment community became convinced that the subject had secured a partnership with the West District Hypercube mine. Overnight, her venture capital firm, Tulip Holdings, surged to the top of the market, with stock and corporate bond prices maintaining an unprecedented high. This unexpected windfall not only restored her standing in Eastside society but also rendered the charges brought by the Financial Inspection Team and Nirvana effectively moot.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject had no permanent residence in Eastside and primarily stayed at various high-end hotels. This arrangement persisted until her detention by the Chief. Although she has since been granted an exemption and is no longer subject to long-term confinement, she continues to frequent the Bureau under the guise of \"visiting friends.\"",
    "Performance 2": "The subject's \"Parfait's Dinner Party\" was once the most exclusive and coveted private event in Eastside. On the surface, they promised little more than \"the chance to dine with Parfait.\" Yet financiers and investors clamored for invitations, pouring fortunes into securing a seat and pulling every string imaginable, all for a shot at winning the favor of the so-called \"investment guru.\"",

    "Performance 4": "The subject holds the Chief in high esteem, often publicly commending the Chief's artistic taste and sophisticated conversation, while also emphasizing their \"close relationship.\" Some speculate that her actions are strategically designed to align herself more closely with the Chief, thereby bolstering the investment community's confidence in her ability to contribute to the West District Hypercube mining project.

    "Criminal Record 2": "As a famous rich heir in Eastside, the subject still keeps his high-profile, absurd style after his arrest. He often describes the Sinners in the Bureau as *boring* during his consultation with the psychologist. Although his nature is impossible to change and he still occasionally harasses staff and advertises products without permission, the MBCC's strictly supervised environment has made it difficult for him to continue his business fraud activity in the Bureau.",

    "Arrest Records 3": "In N.F. 104, Levy's parents were killed in a car accident. Since Levy was too young to take care of his parents' assets, a so-called *committee of the bereaved* comprised exclusively of Levy's relatives was established to take charge of these assets, which were then divided up among the members of the committee. When Levy came of age, he received less than 8% of what he was actually entitled to.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "In N.F. 106, the cracks in the relationships between Levy's relatives began to show. The rifts among the board members were deepening, often leading to bloodshed. By N.F. 110, all the members of the *committee of the bereaved* had fallen out of the public eye—some had committed suicide, some had been murdered, and some had gone bankrupt. Levy now possesses 69.1% of the company's shares, taking back control over his parents' assets.",
    "Performance 1": "As a rule, Levy doesn't turn down the jobs the MBCC asks him to do. But most of the time, he outsources them. Since there's no guarantee that the people Levy outsources the jobs to will complete them satisfactorily, how fast they will be finished, how well, and how completely fluctuate greatly.",
    "Performance 2": "Levy harries the MBCC staffers every now and then. According to some of the victims, Levy \"strikes up a conversation in an awkward manner,\" and the conversation always ends in him trying to sell the garbage his companies are making. But strangely, he steers clear of the Sinners whenever possible. \"Too many lunatics among them. It's too risky. Not worth it,\" Levy once allegedly explained.",
    "Performance 3": "Levy is fun-loving. He proposes on more than one occasion that he fund the establishment of some recreation center within the MBCC, like a bar with music, a room for playing bridge, an amusement arcade, a zoo, and a flea market. All his proposals are vetoed in the end.",
    "Performance 4": "Levy has the habit of launching into farcical hours-long nonsense while sweet-talking his interlocutor into buying his products or signing a business contract full of loopholes.

It seems that she doesn't care about food quality, just sweetness.",
    "Performance 3": "Has an extremely low desire to socialize, and almost never tries to chat with other Sinners and staff. Some Sinners have gone to consult her about plastic surgery out of curiosity, but the staff promptly stopped her from inspecting their faces.",

    "Corruption State": "She has a moderate degree of corruption. Studies suggest that this is due to the long-term use of her abilities. If she continues to use her abilities for an extended period, there is a risk of further spread of Mania.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "She was once involved in a Mania incident with the MBCC Chief. After the incident, she escaped from the scene but was later caught and detained by the MBCC Chief when she resumed live streaming a few days later.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "She once gained a lot of fame from a stream in which she was attacked by a Corruptor. According to her own account, this was a livestream she had meticulously planned, with the aim of attracting public attention.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "She has lived alone for a long time, with few interpersonal relationships. She spends the majority of her income on purchasing live-streaming equipment and materials.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "During her long-term solitary life, she developed a serious dependency on the internet due to her inability to interact normally with others. This led to her strong interest in video games and online forums. To attract attention from others, she repeatedly made radical statements during her live streams. She has been warned and educated by the MBCC Chief.",
    "Performance 1": "She has a strong interest in puffed food, fried food, and carbonated drinks. At the time of her detention, she had a cavity. After treatment, her daily diet is now fully managed by MBCC.",
    "Performance 2": "She is a loyal user of a forum named DisMyth, often frequenting its gaming threads. To draw attention, she often makes provocative or trolling comments. She has had 53 of her accounts banned to date.",
    "Performance 3": "Her weapons, Lævateinn and Svalin, are modeled after the rare hidden sword-shield with a drop rate of less than 0.1% from a once-popular online game called Legion of Warcraft in DisCity. She is currently a hardcore player of Codename: Dark, playing it for more than two hours daily.",
    "Performance 4": "The MBCC Chief finally agreed to her request to livestream, on the condition that she refrains from using her abilities for extended periods and learns to control them. She is currently receiving training at the MBCC."

    "Criminal Record 1": "The heir to a Syndican gang involved in numerous shootouts there and entangled with various gang factions. The subject's suspected of dabbling in the underground circulation of Mania weapons and hence poses a significant threat. Immediate detention is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "It has now been confirmed that the subject's gang was not involved in the circulation of Mania weapons. Her awakening was triggered by forced contact with Mania due to an attack, not out of her own volition. Kind and innocent in nature, the subject got involved in street brawls to protect her family. Under the Bureau's rehabilitation and supervision, she is confirmed to no longer be a threat.",

During the subsequent clash, the subject's strong desire to protect her family and resistance to the unfolding events triggered the awakening of her power.",

    "Arrest Records 1": "While hiding in a residential home in Syndicate, the subject issued a bounty on the dark web for an intel-gathering job. Her identity as a Sinner was exposed following her contact with Chief. The subject was then detained by Chief after the *MBCC Chief Kidnapping Case*.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject was born into the Iron Gang, a medium-sized Syndican gang led by her mother. Kept isolated deliberately by her parents, she's only acquired basic self-defense skills as the heir and is still unaware of the dangerous situation she's in.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject's special power is coveted by all the gangs and the Iron Gang is often besieged by massive attacks consequentially. To avoid burdening her family, the subject has left the gang of her own accord and strives to present herself as a *lady* to dissociate herself from the underworld and sever ties with her past.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The Iron Gang was initially established around debt collection businesses. The subject once openly surrendered during a gang clash, which led to the MBCC being mistakenly regarded as her backing force. The other gangs' wariness has since favored the Iron Gang's development.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject has a deep bond with her family. When she missed home during her early days of detention, she would call her family discreetly and hang up quietly as soon as they answered just to confirm their safety.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject is a loyal fan of DeadLover Radio and enjoys listening to sensational stories. She takes the host's exaggerated remarks a little too seriously and even imitates her.",
    "Performance 3": "With her poor acting skills, the subject can't maintain her *ladylike* image for more than a few hours, often becoming irritated after repeatedly having to hold back on swearing and eventually revealing her true nature. Many Syndican Sinners get along with the subject and commend her for taking the blame after collaborative mischief.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject is keen on studying *ladylike* looks in TV dramas, often seeking Chief's opinions on outfit ideas. If an outfit receives praise from Chief, the subject will wear it without hesitation and refuses to take it off even when her taste gets questioned by the artistic Sinners."

    "Incident": "Letter Forgery",
    "Criminal Record 1": "A resident of Désir outside DisCity, the subject served as the town's mail carrier, a vital link of the social and information network. Hence she was suspected of ties to the de facto governor of the town.\nFurther investigation reveals no direct connection to the leader Vautour Bleu or her group. However, the subject's special power and trusted position allowed her to indirectly empower the said group's illicit activities while spreading Mania throughout the town. Immediate detention is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Interrogation reveals the subject's tragic past filled with traumatic events. Betrayed by fellow villagers and devastated by the loss of her parents, the subject became disillusioned with their ideal of \"a messenger's sacred duty to foster genuine connections.\" She used her special power to forge letters to retaliate against the townspeople she viewed as \"driven by desire\" and insincere. Nonetheless, under Chief's guidance, she recognized her own lingering doubts as well as hopes, began to confront her past, and rediscovered her aspirations, finding her path anew.",
    "Ability Summary": "Using envelopes as vessels, the subject can access memories of the addressers and manipulate their soul fragments to forge reply letters. In combat, she transforms accumulated letters into defensive barriers, cutting projectiles, or fiery attacks.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject awakened her power during an encounter with a Corruptor and became infected with Mania. During the incident, she discovered that her parents had long deceased and all the letters she'd received had been fake. The severe emotional trauma triggered her descent into vengeance.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject displays mild corruption with no visible mutations. Though lucid most of the time, she often develops radical ideas.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject was exposed as a Sinner during Chief's undercover operation in Désir and was confirmed to be abusing her special power. After Désir collapsed, she was apprehended by Chief and transferred to the Bureau for detention and investigation. The subject has been cooperative and on her best behavior since then.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject was born in an impoverished Outland village. A fragile child remaining homebound due to health conditions, she learns things only from the books and letters brought back by her parents, who were both mail carriers. She inherited their ideals of delivering genuine feelings and fostering human connections as a sacred duty.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Not seeing parents for long since their last delivery, the subject ventured out to search for them, only to discover they had long died. The letters she had been receiving were forged by the villagers lusting after the inheritance, even their names stained and dishonored all this time. The revelation caused her severe emotional trauma, devastating her beliefs.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Following her awakening of power, the subject began composing and delivering forged mail as her revenge against humanity, completely abandoning her previous code of ethics. Evidence indicates that her and her fellow villagers' coming to Désir was also driven by a forged invitation letter, possibly part of her broader revenge scheme.",
    "Performance 1": "After arriving at the Bureau with her cherished bicycle, the subject was warmly invited to join the Cycling Club. Unaware that the club focused on competitive cycling, she participated in her first event with her slow and wobbly riding style, finishing last. Other members later collectively gifted her an indoor electric bicycle for use within the Bureau.",
    "Performance 2": "Though the subject has always cherished reading, her isolated upbringing limited her access to books. At the Bureau, she has thrived in the new environment and become a regular visitor to the library. She soon discovered that the \"DisCity Classics\" series she had read in the past were in fact bootleg editions with significantly altered content, much to her shock.",
    "Performance 3": "During her early days at the Bureau, the subject sought to build trust by delivering forged letters, inadvertently fostering numerous but shallow relationships. Only after rediscovering her true purpose and no longer relying on forged letters for emotional comfort did she begin forming true and genuine friendships.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject handpicked a set of decorative stationery along with a fountain pen, ink, envelopes, handmade wax seals, and postal stamps as a gift, inviting Chief to share thoughts and book reviews through written letters. Likening it to keeping a shared diary more than making pen pals, Chief has gladly accepted her proposal."

    "Criminal Record 1": "A young, streetwise real estate agent with extensive professional experience who has built a reputation in Eastside for specializing in selling cheap haunted properties.\nInvestigation confirms that all residential properties handled by the subject have been deliberately cleaned up and contain unusual residue of Mania, suggesting extended presence of Corruptors. Currently, the subject stands accused of harboring Corruptors and is under serious suspicion of spreading Mania. Immediate detention and thorough investigation are recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Further investigation confirms that the suspect harbored Corruptors solely to fabricate supernatural phenomena in these haunted properties, with no intention of harming others. During her detention, under Chief's guidance, she has gradually let go of her obsession with houses and the concept of home, reflected on her past actions, and is now willing to consider the Bureau as somewhere she could return to. Following a risk reassessment, she has been granted parole and routinely returns to the Bureau for a short stay to report her updates.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can imprison specific targets with her weapon, forbidding them from moving or attacking, causing them to gradually lose their strength.",

    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject is from Eastside. Her family struggled financially when she was young and she had to lie about her age to support herself, thus accumulating extensive experience in agency work from an early age. She claims that selling haunted properties is a way to make money, and in doing so she gets to fulfill the demand of a niche market while attracting thrill-seeking customers interested in touring such locations.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject lost both parents at an early age and was raised by her grandmother. Their only home was fraudulently seized and demolished by an unscrupulous real estate developer without any compensation, leaving her family homeless. Unable to afford Eastside's rising housing costs, she was forced to relocate frequently, constantly moving homes. The nomadic lifestyle proved too burdensome for her elderly grandmother, who eventually fell ill from exhaustion and passed away.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The experience of losing her childhood home and the death of her only family induced in the subject an unusual obsession with houses. In order to help others in Eastside in similar situations buy their own homes, she exploits the properties of Corruptors to fabricate supernatural phenomena, driving down the prices of these artificial *haunted houses*. When necessary, she would even go as far as harming herself to reach her goal.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject eagerly expands her real estate business within the Bureau by tailoring sales pitches to fit her potential clients' specific circumstances. Rumor has it that she carries over a hundred keys in her trench coat and can match each to its corresponding property perfectly.",
    "Performance 2": "Demonstrating remarkable talent and dedication in product marketing, the subject frequently helps out at the Supply Office and shares her experience with Faye. Through their collaborative efforts, sales figures of various products in the Bureau have seen substantial growth within a short period.",
    "Performance 3": "As required by her job, the subject has consumed numerous horror books and films and is an excellent ghost story teller. She often gives certain squeamish Sinners nightmares with her tales, then proceeds to sell them her DIY protective talismans.",
    "Performance 4": "Besides her *Eastside AAA-Tier Top Real Estate Agent* work social media account, the subject has even added Chief with her private account, which she uses to report every trivial matter and even sends promotional mass mails. After Chief threatened to block her, she finally held back her chat messages reluctantly for two days."

After the Legion hired the subject, it equipped the subject with a massive special alloy sword to realize that shocking destructive power.",

    "Performance 4": "Influenced by Hella, the subject's hostility toward Chief has greatly lessened. Once, the subject even initiated a conversation with Chief to ask for larger food portions.\n\"I can't fight on an empty stomach.\""

    "Criminal Record 1": "The only suspect who caused the riot at Eastside Baseball League. Permanently banned for competing and boycotted by the entire baseball world due to causing malicious harm to people at the game.\nThe subject is classified as a dangerous Sinner as the subject is suspected of fabricating identity, hiding special powers, being involved with the dangerous organization \"The Homeless,\" and acting recklessly.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject has not gone manic or out of control since detention. Interrogation reveals that she once competed in matches as a local Syndican baseball team member and attempted to train in Eastside, but was rejected due to the friction between the two cities. The subject thus had to seek aid from the Homeless, but her special power awakened in an accident during her trip to Eastside. She then lost control of her power and hurt someone.\nSince her recapture after the escape, her behavior has improved under Chief's supervision. She currently has fairly good control over her power.",
    "Ability Summary": "Special powers are triggered by emotional excitement or swinging the bat multiple times, which can greatly enhance Dolly's power and relieves her pain.",

    "Arrest Records 3": "Before the Eastside baseball game started, the subject's identity as a Syndican was exposed and received many criticisms, which seriously intensified the Mania symptoms. During the game, the subject's emotions eventually went out of control and seriously injured the opponents. The subject was sent off.",

She is suspected to be connected with other dangerous and mysterious factions. Irritable and belligerent, she presents a major threat to Syndicate's social stability.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject is naturally combative and often gets into trouble. After the great riot, she became even more violent under the Deus Corpus's control. Fortunately, since the Square Black Ring incident, her moods and character have undergone certain changes. She's become significantly less aggressive and more stable and she has a firmer grasp over her power.\nHer leadership has grown more prominent ever since she took part in the mission against the Public Security Bureau remnants' attack on the Legion. The Bureau currently trains her specifically in that aspect.",
    "Ability Summary": "Making use of the Battle Mark on her arm to wield her heavy battleaxe, her destructive capabilities are not to be underestimated. The Battle Mark grows in strength given the right circumstances, further enhancing her combat abilities. With such a heavy weapon, her attacks are relatively slow.",

    "Arrest Records 4": "Nirvana Convoy got into a conflict against the gangsters. To protect her, the subject's brother Earl was injured and disabled.

    "Performance 2": "Window-shops at kawaii-style fashion shops often. Horo claims that the style contradicts the Legion's dress code, and forces herself to walk away. To our knowledge, the Legion does not enforce a dress code.",
    "Performance 3": "Whenever the word \"Zoya\" is spoken in MBCC, Horo will always appear in a 10-meter radius, watching silently. If a Sinner is discovered to be speaking ill of Zoya, she will leap from the shadows and duel for her honor.",
    "Performance 4": "Horo has held a grand ceremony in the Bureau, giving Chief a medal engraved with \"Zoya & Horo's Best Friend\". According to her, the medal can be used to command any member of the Legion, at any time."

    "Criminal Record 2": "Since her admission to the MBCC, the subject has been repeatedly consulting the psychologist in the Bureau. Her file reveals that although her power enables her to forge weapons with human malice, the subject herself has demonstrated a pathological fear of the malice and is often troubled by nightmares. Her previous abnormal behaviors should be attributed to her severe chronic mental illness. She likely requires further consultation and treatment.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject's power allows her to collect malevolent energies and turn them into tangible objects, which she then uses to forge powerful weapons.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject awakened her power when she was severely traumatized at a young age in the [Data Deleted] Incident.

Later in her career, Mess also started inciting her customers to cause harm in exchange for a remission of service fees.

    "Performance 2": "Mess frequently asks the Supply Office to purchase the latest dolls, clothes, and ornaments on her behalf. These purchases soon end up in her furnace when she loses interest in them.",
    "Performance 3": "Mess enjoys driving wedges between the other Sinners and encouraging them to fight each other. So far, thirteen fights have taken place as a direct result of her meddling. Contact between Mess and the other Sinners should be prohibited, unless it's absolutely necessary.",
    "Performance 4": "Recently, Mess has taken a keen interest in Chief, going to extraordinary lengths to encourage Chief to hurt other people, but to no avail. Mess has also been secretly providing weapons for those Sinners who harbor hatred, saying, \"I've got your back. Just go out there and raise hell; I'll provide you with weapons.\""

    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject had been a competitive fighter in the underground fighting world. Boasting a fierce and cut-throat personality, she exhibits an usually strong thirst for combat, and has a history of arrest for inciting unrest while fighting in the ring.

    "Arrest Records 2": "As a child, the subject was homeless and roamed Syndicate before getting taken in by a dog pound, where she ate and lived with the dogs. She was later expelled from the pound after getting into a fight with some competitive fighters. This spurred her to join the underground fighting industry.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Small in stature, the subject lacks the strength of other fighters, so she wins her fights with clever tricks. However, her tricksy fighting style is widely despised. Many think it goes against the long-held Syndicate tradition of valuing sheer strength, and thus reject her.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject skyrocketed to fame after using her Sinner power to win a major competition, becoming a fan favorite in the underground fighting world. However, many arenas shut down after Zoya destroyed the gangs. The subject went back to living in the streets, and later joined Rustfire.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject is passionate about any combat mission, and will even request extra tasks. When she fails to exhaust her energy, she'll challenge other Sinners to fight, but there is rarely anyone willing to accept her challenge. Everyone basically responds by giving her their own assignment.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject regards make-up as \"combat gear\" and asks the Supply Office to procure all kinds of make-up for her. According to her, flamboyant makeup is a must-have in battle, as it is an effective way to intimidate and deter opponents.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject loves to craft weapons and props. She sometimes takes her creations to chat with Sinner Mess, whom she praises as \"very insightful.\" The subject likes to use garbage found around the Bureau as crafting materials, and sometimes even goes out scavenging with Sinner Demolia.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject once handed Chief a huge sum of money and explained it was prize money earned from a fighting match she joined while out on dispatch. She generously declared that she'll hand over all future prize money if the Bureau turned a blind eye to such disciplinary violations. After accepting the money, Chief tightened disciplinary measures for Sinners out on dispatch."

She applied four times but was rejected each time, and was finally admitted with her uncle's recommendation.\nShe has an almost obsessive desire for \"justice\" and her mental state is unstable. She frequently resorts to violence to solve cases. Her behavior is quite unpredictable. Detainment is advised.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Naturally cheerful and optimistic, the subject's unstable mental condition stems from two major incidents: her parents' deaths and the discovery of Shalom's true identity. After being detained by the MBCC, she demonstrated good and helpful behavior without any violations, earning unanimous praise from the Bureau. Under the guidance and company of Chief, she still firmly believes in and pursues justice, but her stubbornness has softened, and she rarely experiences emotional breakdowns or loss of control.",
    "Ability Summary": "When she knows she's carrying out \"justice,\" her combat power increases proportionally to the degree of justice. Moreover, she must firmly believe in her own sense of justice, otherwise she will suffer a backlash from her power and fall into depression. Her preferred weapons include a special Detective File reinforced with metal, and a special cane embedded with a small amount of Hypercubes and rare metals. These weapons are highly destructive when used alongside her power.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject's emotions became extremely unstable after learning of her parents' death.

However, her inner turmoil never settled, leading her to obsessively compile relevant evidence and events to uncover the truth behind her parents' deaths and avenge them.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject has known her younger cousin Mireya since childhood, but they often clashed and didn't have a smooth relationship. It wasn't until the Garden assassination case in N.F. 112, when her uncle was killed, that Mireya truly understood and acknowledged her. Their relationship greatly improved afterwards.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "At the lowest point in her life, the subject learned how to use her power. With the help and encouragement of HUSH (Shalom), she embarked on a path of seeking justice. However, she was then traumatized by discovering Shalom's true identity, and became determined to prove her sense of justice to her.",
    "Performance 1": "The luggage she brought with her when she joined the MBCC included a large collection of detective novels, which she continues to add to. The subject is intimately familiar with crime fiction, and has offered many valuable suggestions for mystery-themed films for the Recreation Area's movie nights.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject maintains a positive attitude towards life, taking her daily training and dispatch assignments seriously and always striving to complete them to the best of her ability. Although she often causes equipment wear and tear due to poor control of her strength, she still sets a good example for the other Sinners.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject is outgoing and can strike up a pleasant conversation with anyone. She's well-liked within the Bureau, and her positive influence has impacted many Sinners who were originally introverted and melancholic. Additionally, she's known for being always ready to help, and is enthusiastic in helping both Sinners and Bureau staff with life and work problems without expecting anything in return.",
    "Performance 4": "Despite being at the MBCC, the subject has never slackened in her duties and work as the Acting Inspector. She voluntarily uses her downtime to read and organize case files sent by the Public Security Bureau, dragging along Chief, whom she refers to as her \"assistant,\" to work on cases outside."

    "Performance 1": "After joining the MBCC, the subject demonstrated outstanding efficiency at work, completing tasks with astonishing speed and execution. However, she burns through the Bureau's budget by causing additional public damage from time to time. She says that she will try to avoid this in the future.",

    "Performance 4": "The subject is dedicated to ensuring normal working hours for MBCC employees, and demands a corresponding increase in overtime pay.

Assassinated multiple important politicians, entrepreneurs, and gang leaders. Involved in over a hundred murders in which all targets were killed by one critical attack. No clues about the subject's identity and whereabouts were ever exposed and the subject posed an immense threat to the safety of big shots in different domains.",

The subject has long quit *the Garden* and claims to have left all her illegal businesses behind. She plans to spend the rest of her life with Chief. Though her statement is hard to verify, judging from her behavior, she seems to mean it genuinely.",

    "Arrest Records 1": "Before the arrest, the subject had long been a wanted criminal for a failed attempt to assassinate Chief, but her whereabouts were elusive.

    "Arrest Records 3": "After a brief period of discreet activity as the assassin of the *Garden*, the subject debuted as *Sumire the ikebana artist* in high society. Thanks to her artistry in ikebana, she was fairly well-known among the upper class and had many fans. The subject was able to frequent important occasions with her forged identity which provided convenience for her assassination work.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject had already quit the organization and ceased ikebana activity before the arrest.

    "Criminal Record 1": "An art dealer active among the rich and famous of Eastside, but in private, she gets involved in all manner of shady activities that concern art and money, including appraisal of collectibles, proxy buying of masterpieces, job placement, selling of forgeries, and plagiarism. McQueen's studio engages in innumerable illicit dealings, and McQueen has cultivated quite a reputation for herself in the black market in recent years.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Besides her special power, the subject also possesses masterful art forgery skills. She has a more profound gift for art than regular art forgers, but she will never admit it. Compared to when she's interrogated by other staff, the subject definitely appears more cooperative and more willing to talk about herself when interacting with Chief.\nUnder the MBCC's strict supervision, the subject's art forgery business has entirely ceased since her detention.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject's power allows her to make replicas of objects. For her power to work, she needs to possess an adequate knowledge of the object she wishes to replicate. As a rule, McQueen can only replicate a work of art or herself, with the replica and the original being slightly different.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject awakened her power on account of the strong emotions she felt when she was betrayed and almost lost her life, an experience that left her both traumatized and disillusioned.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject suffers from a medium level of Maniac corruption. No visible abnormalities have been found on her body, but she is mentally unstable, troubled by occasional nightmares. The Maniac energies inside her seem to have magnified her dark side, leading her to destructive actions that defy comprehension.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "The subject crosses paths with MBCC Sinners during the Witching Hour Exhibition in the Belphegor Art Museum. She escapes when it's discovered that she's a Sinner trying to make replicas. As soon as the exhibition ends, the MBCC carries out a search and arrests McQueen; the MBCC is also able to gather evidence of McQueen making forgeries.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject, who used to go by the name of Jennie, was an art student at a college of art in Eastside. During her school years, she stayed on the straight and narrow and had a great passion for art. But the collectors in the profession doubted her talents and potential as an artist, despite complimenting her on her efforts.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The negative reviews sent her down a spiral of depression. It was when she was at rock bottom that she met an art dealer called McQueen in an art gallery and was unknowingly led onto the path of art forgery by the art dealer's lies and deception. When she found out, she had a falling-out with the art dealer, awakening her power in the process, which directly led to the death of the art dealer.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "This experience left Jennie disillusioned about the entire art scene. She abandoned her old name and gave up her career as an artist, going deeper into the forgery market as an art dealer under the new name McQueen. Ever since then, she has been making forgeries that are passed off as genuine, in an effort to get back at the Eastside art world that has failed her.",
    "Performance 1": "McQueen keeps in her room a few Klein blue ornaments and decorations, which she takes great care to wipe immaculately clean. When she notices that many MBCC staffers and Sinners show interest in them, she insists that they come over to take a look and asks to them guess if a particular item is fake or genuine. And as it turns out, all of her collectibles are fake.",
    "Performance 2": "Every time McQueen goes to Eastside for a mission, she almost always encounters someone she knows, from upper-class customers to black market brokers. Man or woman, young or old, they all have a good rapport with McQueen. On a few occasions, McQueen even managed to quickly sell one forgery or two to a passerby when the MBCC staffers' backs were turned.",
    "Performance 3": "McQueen is easy-going, stylish, attractive, and a people person through and through. Her popularity within the MBCC is climbing into the stratosphere. This pleases her so much that she creates several clones of herself to cater to a growing fan base.",
    "Performance 4": "McQueen insists on using such saccharine terms of endearment as *Darling*, *Baby*, and *Beauty* to address Chief, and tries out such acts as head-touching and Kabedon on Chief time and again. These tricks don't work on Chief, but that doesn't discourage her in the slightest."

    "Criminal Record 2": "After a series of investigation and interrogation, it's found that the subject had been constantly bullied and isolated due to her background and timidity. Her power awakened and went out of control as she tried to exercise self-defense but not intentional harm. None of the students injured during the Eastside school incident was fatally harmed and all of them have since been discharged from the hospital.\nBesides, under Chief's encouragement and mediation, the subject has gradually come out of the mental restraints her family has put on her and is determined to start a new life.",
    "Ability Summary": "Lynn's eye releases energy blasts continuously, and she has no control over it. The energy blasts are highly destructive but can be prevented from spreading into the environment with a helmet made from a special material.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Lynn's weak character, which, compounded by her Syndican origins, made her an object of ridicule and bullying. She endured attacks from her fellow students without protest until she awakened her power out of an overpowering urge for self-preservation when her right eye was slashed by a utility knife. The energy blast she released on that occasion was so powerful that it eliminated everything in its path.",

Still, the family was ostracized by Eastside society because of their origins, and Lynn was a long-time sufferer of unfair treatment in school.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Lynn ran away in the wake of the Eastside School Incident. In her haste to put distance behind her, Lynn slipped and fell into a drainage ditch on a construction site. She gathered scrap from the ditch and assembled a helmet that could hem her power in. She had been wearing the helmet ever since while living in Eastside's sewage system, coming out only at night.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Lynn is mousy and withdrawn, avoiding human contact like the plague. A talented photographer who has never received any formal training, she takes great photographs simply by instinct. The skyscrapers in Eastside hold little appeal for her. What tickles her imagination as a photographer is the unorthodoxy of Drifter Camp, the ruggedness of the Syndican border, and the colorfulness of people's everyday life.",
    "Performance 1": "When Lynn was a newcomer to the MBCC, she put up a wall around her with her shyness. She never initiated a conversation, and when she was dragged into one, she averted her eyes throughout. Her awkwardness was most obvious when she was interacting with Sinners who were excessively friendly.",
    "Performance 2": "Lynn balks at the idea of engaging in battle, but she's dutiful and dedicated when it comes to non-combat tasks assigned by the MBCC, doing her utmost to complete as many tasks as possible and complete them as satisfactorily as possible.",
    "Performance 3": "Lynn has a good taste and is very handy. She makes lovely handicrafts in her free time. The Sinners and staffers often come to her for handicrafts to use as trinkets or ornaments, and she seems to relish the feeling of being needed.",
    "Performance 4": "Lynn has been acting strange lately. On more than one occasion, she opened her mouth to say something in front of Chief, only to clamp it shut. Only after days of self-debate does she pluck up the courage and, cheeks flushing red, ask if Chief would like to be the subject of a photobook."

Amidst the chaos, the only thing she managed to hold onto was a button from her younger brother's coat. She wears it close to her heart every day, claiming it brings the warmth and presence of her family around her.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject unveils a dark secret behind her awakening: Top brass from FAC had covertly ordered their dad to move a corrupting Mania substance without him knowing. This act morphed him into a Corruptor right in their own home, sparking a family tragedy. Fueled by a thirst for vengeance, the subject aligned with the Garden and has, so far, exacted revenge on every key player linked to this horror.",
    "Performance 1": "After being brought onboard, the subject admits she's not cut out for the front lines and instead volunteers to help with behind-the-scenes tasks. The team can't help but admire her gentle touch, patience, and reliable way of getting things done.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject often requests sewing supplies from the Supply Office, supposedly because she's inundated with outfit requests from both Sinners and staff. Chief has put out several notices to address this, but things haven't changed much.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject has a big heart for every Sinner, going the extra mile for the younger ones. Folks often say she has a strong motherly vibe. Beyond always being up for any tailoring tasks, she's known to share their homemade treats and homey wisdom, making her a favorite around the Bureau.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject once crafted a shirt for Chief. Investigations reveal it's the only personal item left behind during the subject's escape. Though security cleared the shirt of threats, a withered carnation lay hidden inside."

    "DOB": "January 30",
    "Height": "168cm",
    "Alignment": "LIMBO",
    "Ability": "Material Anomaly",
    "Incident": "Suburban Factory Explosion Incident",
    "Criminal Record 1": "Originally from Eastside, Eureka has been dedicated to the research and manufacture of various eccentric inventions for years. Her contraptions are often hard to control and have caused numerous disturbances disrupting public order.\nSubsequent investigation revealed that an allegedly man-made explosion occurred in a suburban factory when Eureka was an employee there. As a major suspect, she was to be immediately detained and interrogated.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Upon interrogation, it was learned that Eureka didn't intentionally make the weapons that harmed innocent civilians but was deceived and coerced into doing so. During her detention in the MBCC, she proves to be sincere and kind, earning the favor and recognition of many within the Bureau. Under Chief's supervision and guidance, invention-related accidents have also significantly reduced. Eureka is evaluated to be no longer a threat to society.",
    "Ability Summary": "Her special power can change or enhance a material's properties, facilitating her invention process. Her weapon of choice is a specially modified screwdriver which she uses as a tool in daily life and as a slender sword in combat.",
    "Awakening Signs": "According to Eureka, she awakened as a Sinner several years ago when she accidentally touched Mania-tainted raw materials while manufacturing weapons in a black market workshop.",
    "Corruption State": "Physical examination results show that Eureka's level of corruption is low with no physical mutations, and all indicators are within the normal range. She is generally lucid and emotionally stable, with occasional fluctuations when recalling past experiences.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "Chief met Eureka at the Buonanotte Toy Factory. After the incident, she returned to the MBCC with Chief and willingly turned herself in without any resistance.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "She is absent-minded and reticent, yet her mind is a playground of ideas with boundless imagination. She is obsessed with invention and creation, often traveling to various places in search of fresh inspiration. Beyond her string of novel yet impractical inventions, she seems to have a fair understanding of weapon development as well.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Born into a humble working-class family in Eastside, Eureka's childhood was rather stifling. With her parents' tough lives, they projected all their hopes onto her, frequently chastising her for mediocre grades and her penchant for handicrafts. Her school life was no different. Her eccentric hobbies earned her the label of a *freak*, leading to isolation and bullying.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "During her university years, Eureka met her best friend Jessie. With aligned interests, they often collaborated on invention and research. After dropping out of school, she followed Jessie to work at her uncle's factory. It wasn't until she accidentally touched Mania-tainted materials and awakened as a Sinner that she realized the factory was in fact a black market weapon workshop. Unwilling to aid in the making of harmful inventions, she seized an opportunity to cause a disturbance and successfully escaped the factory.",
    "Performance 1": "Even after joining the MBCC, she's never ceased her invention. However, the constant noise from her room greatly disrupted the daily life of other Sinners in the Bureau. A small workshop was thus set up in a secluded corner specifically for her creative endeavors.",
    "Performance 2": "Despite not being a social expert, she is passionate about repairing things for others. With her handy skills, she can easily make any severely worn item brand new again. But she can't always resist the urge to modify all ordinary objects. Recently, the Bureau had to deal with the peculiar sight of self-rotating flying trash cans whizzing down the corridors.",
    "Performance 3": "Gentle and friendly, she rarely comes into conflict with others. Her dazzling array of novel inventions has piqued the interest of many Sinners and staff members. Some of the more generous Sinners have repeatedly funded the research for her new inventions.",
    "Performance 4": "It is roughly estimated that ever since joining the MBCC, Eureka has gifted Chief with a variety of special inventions, including an Emergency Ejection Chair, a Gesture Communication Watch, a pair of Lightning Escape Shoes, an Auto Strikeback Shield, and a Nightmare Catcher Helmet. Although most of these have never been put to actual use, she continues to pack Chief's office with new gadgets. This could be an awkward friendly gesture on her part."

    "Criminal Record 1": "Trained by the Garden, she was tasked with assassinating the president of the Future Charity Foundation during an operation targeting Paradeisos officials. After being captured and incarcerated by the Eastside Public Security Bureau, she collaborated and executed escape attempts with other Sinners, causing social unrest with a detrimental impact. Immediate detention and interrogation is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Interrogation and testimonies from other Sinners reveal that after losing both parents, the subject joined the Garden seeking a chance for vengeance. She was briefly trained and participated in only a few missions. Most of her aggressive actions are a response to her protective urge. Since her detention, she's been comforted by the stable living environment, companions, and Chief's promise. Her mind has gradually stabilized, and she has rediscovered her passion for life.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can form a flame blade in her palm or line the weapon she's holding with fire and extend the blade. The flames possess all the characteristics of ordinary fire and can continue burning with blood as fuel upon contact with wounds.",
    "Awakening Signs": "While searching for her mother, she accidentally uncovered a conspiracy by the mastermind. She followed the suspect to the Rust and witnessed another victim become part of the broken wall. As the subject was infected by the Rust's highly concentrated Mania and under extreme anger, panic, and grief, her special power awakened.",
    "Corruption State": "With a lighter degree of corruption, her body shows no physical signs of mutation. Though mostly sane, she's impulsive and exceedingly stubborn in nature. It's believed that she is still under the influence of Mania.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "She was suspected to be hiding in Syndicate with the remnants of the Garden and her Mentor, but the Bureau did not detect her presence during the arrest of the Garden's remnants. A few days after the detention, she planned and executed an assassination attempt on Chief alone, which failed and resulted in her capture by the Bureau.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject's father was a member of the FAC, and her mother worked at a publishing house before marriage. After her father died on a mission in N.F. 103, her mother gave up all her benefits and moved to the outskirts of Eastside to raise the subject alone. Despite their impoverished life, the subject continued to receive a normal education and engage in social activities.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "After failing to file for her mother's disappearance in N.F. 111, the subject attempted to investigate on her own and accidentally discovered that her mother was killed for persistently seeking the truth about her father's death. Her power awakened by the shock, she vowed to seek vengeance and disappeared at the end of N.F. 111. The subject admits to have joined the Garden to prepare herself for her revenge.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "After completing her revenge, she saw protecting the Garden as her new purpose and helped the severely injured Garden's Mentor and the group's remnants relocate to their hideout in Syndicate. She continued to sharpen her skills at the same time, gradually becoming independent. However, she remains deeply concerned about her Mentor's health and constantly worries about lacking the strength to protect her family.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject has always kept her journaling habit inherited from her mother. Whenever possible, she spends over an hour writing and drawing in her journal daily. She also uses ginkgo leaves to make handicrafts like roses. Since the materials are easy to obtain and the products are delightful, many Sinners have asked her for lessons.",
    "Performance 2": "She loves wandering the streets and visiting shops, especially bakeries, boutiques, and arcades with claw machines. She knows all about the locations, styles, and price ranges of these stores. Whenever she gets a chance during any mission in Eastside, she makes sure to drop by these places and bring back gifts for the other Sinners, especially the members of the Garden.",
    "Performance 3": "After losing her parents, she's been consumed by vengeance, often disguising herself with an aggressive façade and believing herself unpopular. However, following incidents like giving up a limited edition doll to Mess and helping design decorative laces for Lynn's helmet, her sincerity and kindness have become an open secret among Sinners of her age.",
    "Performance 4": "She gifted Chief a thick limited edition journal and suggested Chief too should jot down three happy moments each day for memories and mood regulation. She even lent some of her own journals to Chief for inspiration."

    "Incident": "Spreading Negativity in Dark Web Communities",
    "Criminal Record 1": "Born into an immigrant merchant family, the subject is now a student at a private school renowned for its strict regime. Not only is she a perfect daughter in her parents' eyes, she is also a straight-A student for her teachers. According to close examination of her files, the subject has never used her power to instigate trouble or harm anyone.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Interrogation reveals that the subject mistook malicious impulses for negative emotions due to familial and educational influence. Having repressed her true feelings for years, she failed to form any meaningful emotional attachment and learn to relate to other people, resulting in her perverse ways of venting. As Chief helped the subject find an appropriate outlet for her pent-up feelings and a correct way of internalization, the subject was enabled to learn about the truth, get over hard feelings, establish wholesome emotional attachments and embark on a healthy path.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can control and rewrite the genetic factors in spores, making them grow rapidly into large mushrooms for various combat purposes. The subject can also use her rewriting ability to change her appearance, breathing, heartbeat, and growth rate, even reducing them to a fungal level (almost zero).",
    "Awakening Signs": "According to the subject and her mother's accounts, the subject became a Sinner due to maternal infection. Her abilities awakened under the emotional influence of her mother who was placed in extreme circumstances, enabling the subject to camouflage herself for self-preservation.",
    "Corruption State": "The subject's corruption level is moderate, but her camouflage ability prevents any visible mutations. She's sane most of the time but often has radical thoughts.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "After the Elysiland incident, the subject caught Chief's attention due to her actions on the island and was detained for investigation at the Bureau, during which she behaved well. Considering the subject's close social ties, to avoid further complications, Chief pretended as her summer camp instructor when arresting her, to which she reacted cooperatively.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject appears to come from a wealthy and harmonious family, but in reality she has been living under extreme stress. This has resulted in long-term self-repression and an inability to relieve her pent-up frustration through normal social interactions. The subject could only vent by initiating radical discourse on a dark web forum and finding solace in other netizens in similar situations.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Excellent at concealing her true nature, the subject knows how to act like a well-behaved straight-A student to fit into her family's pleasant image. She's even earned social capital for her family and is therefore their *favorite*. However, beneath this facade, the subject continues to suffer scrutiny and neglect due to certain past events.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "While still in her mother's womb, the subject was infected with Mania because of a family feud. Although she awakened as a Sinner and protected herself and her mother, the premature death of her other sibling led to silent rejection from her family members. Despite the subject's slightly egocentric character due to Mania's influence, she has never harmed anyone and is not the *monster* her prejudiced family makes her out to be.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject is a fast learner and perfectly capable of taking care of herself. She consistently meets course goals and completes daily tasks punctually. However, random inspection reveals that the subject hasn't completely overcome the occasional laziness and playfulness typical of kids her age. The only difference is that she's able to perform well in class even after staying up all night surfing the dark web.",
    "Performance 2": "Possibly due to her mutation, the subject's sense of taste is extremely insensitive. Although the subject claims her favorite food is her mother's onion meat roll and that she dislikes broccoli, she once ate two servings of broccoli (and some food other Sinners slipped into her plate) while distracted without protest.",
    "Performance 3": "Habitually keeping her camouflage when first arriving at the Bureau, the subject actively tried to expand her network and successfully fit into the Sinner community. But deep down, the subject's not very sociable. Having gradually adapted to the environment and accepted her true self, her social circle has shrunk to include only Sinners of similar age or those with compatible personalities.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject once left a delicate postcard on Chief's desk containing a dark web URL and a set of login credentials. Upon logging in, Chief discovered a secret forum accessible only to two users, in which all posts were personal thoughts the subject had noted down."

After changing her name, she became active online as a mukbang content creator.\nInvestigation reveals that hunger causes the subject to collapse mentally and lose control of her Mania, posing a great threat to society. Temporary detention and monitoring are recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Investigation reveals that the subject's emotional instability was caused by years of excessive control by her mother. During her time at the Bureau, she has received guidance and can now control her desires and emotions. She has consistently demonstrated good behavior and actively participated in various activities. Currently, she no longer requires mandatory detention and only needs to return to the Bureau for routine examinations.",

During these episodes, she bit multiple civilians and caused small-scale explosions. After that, she quit showbiz and dropped out of school.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "After venturing into the livestreaming industry on her own, she endured long-term emotional and physical abuse from her management company. She was forced to eat strange foods and do competitive eating in front of the camera. Although she wished to leave the company, she was unable to pay the *massive penalty fee* her manager repeatedly threatened her about. With no other options, she came to the Bureau seeking protection.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject's real name is Nibella. Since a young age, she had been under her mother's excessive control, with her diet strictly regulated to maintain an attractive figure for modeling. Years of living under her mother's constraints rendered her unable to control her own emotions and desires. Consequently, when facing external pressure, she would often resort to extreme behaviors as a coping mechanism. It's been observed that her binge-eating behavior is actually a form of rebellion.",
    "Performance 1": "She loves eating and has an astonishing appetite, which caused the Bureau's cafeteria to overrun its budget several times. She particularly enjoys sweets and rice, and frequently exchanges culinary insights with Ignis. However, she is not skilled at cooking and could almost be characterized as a disaster in the kitchen.",
    "Performance 2": "As a former child model, the subject has her own unique fashion sense. She favors dopamine-inducing colors in her clothing and cute, colorful accessories. She often covers the minor mutations on her body with food-themed stickers.",
    "Performance 3": "Friendly, outgoing, and a mood-maker, she is well-liked within the Bureau. During her stay, she made quite a few friends/dining partners. She also frequently carried rice balls around, which she gave out to Sinners she deemed to be looking hungry.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject viewed Chief as her designated feeder in the Bureau. Whenever she felt she hadn't eaten enough, she would confidently stroll into Chief's office with various excuses to mooch food and drinks."

Detention and supervision of the subject during her temporary stay in DisCity is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "It has been clarified that the subject's abilities are closely related to the customs and geography of Eastia, so their effectiveness is limited in DisCity. Additionally, she was deeply demoralized by the failure of the Sun Shot, leading to a series of unintentionally inaccurate *prophecies*. Her true character is sincere and lively and she always acts out of goodwill. She gradually regained her abilities and faith as a seer during her temporary stay in DisCity, under the guidance and companionship of Chief. She has now left DisCity to return to Eastia.

    "Arrest Records 4": "As a child, she lost her parents to a disaster.

Under her grandmother's guidance, she learned about pursuing the gods, hoping to use the divine power to fulfill people's wishes and lead them to overcome disasters.",
    "Performance 1": "She often resorts to superstitious customs and rituals to solve problems.

    "Performance 2": "The subject doesn't possess regular common sense gained from real-life experience, so she often makes misjudgments due to her distorted moral values. As she continues to communicate with others, this discrepancy between her mental age and physical age is gradually lessening.",
    "Performance 3": "Often raises philosophical questions to other Sinners. Though the subject has no ill intention, the people who get asked tend to feel like they've taken a hit in their brains and will begin to doubt their entire existence.",
    "Performance 4": "Once tried to perceive life by keeping small animals as pets, but got stopped by the staff due to the cruelty of the process. Recently, the subject has been preying on plants instead and still refuses to give up after already causing the death of more than a dozen plants. Apparently, she wants to grow a white rose to express her love for Chief."

    "Criminal Record 2": "Proper public awareness of Sinners had not yet been formed when the incident happened, which resulted in severe emotional repression in the subject during her formative years.

It is recommended to detain the subject immediately and conduct an investigation.",

Her behavior violated the city's public security regulations and posed a certain threat to the public. The subject should be detained as soon as possible.",

    "Arrest Records 4": "With her inaccurate self-perception, the subject boldly performed at an important event at the orphanage and caused an accident which indirectly led to a decrease in adoption applications that year.

    "Performance 2": "The subject's music has gained a special *reputation* within the MBCC. Her saxophone recording was once selected as the Bureau's alarm ringtone, proving remarkably effective for late risers. The subject likes to boast about this achievement and is now even more convinced that she's indeed a genius saxophonist.",
    "Performance 3": "The subject once protested alongside the Sinners who she shared the music equipment room with, demanding that the Bureau provide soundproof facilities. Their request was continually denied. It was only until a passing staff member fainted after hearing her practicing the saxophone that their request was finally accepted.",

Whenever she has a sudden burst of inspiration and composes her own *exclusive pieces*, she always invites Chief to be the first audience, often waiting outside Chief's office with her saxophone."

Furthermore, she has repeatedly exaggerated her patients' conditions in a fear-mongering manner.

After experiencing a series of disasters including the destruction of her hometown and the deaths of loved ones, she once struggled to understand the meaning of saving lives. However, she never abandoned her calling, continuously seeking answers through her medical practice across various regions.\nUnder Chief's guidance, the subject has gradually let go of ideas troubling her, choosing to follow her heart.

She firmly believes in the principle of karmic cycles, convinced that by performing good deeds and amassing good karma, she can reverse her constant misfortune.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "She was born into a medical sect in Eastia and studied medicine from a young age. However, her hometown was later destroyed by a disaster. Despite the desperate efforts of her parents and fellow sect members—all healers themselves—they were unable to change the situation, and ultimately all perished. This event caused severe psychological trauma to her, profoundly shaking her faith as a healer.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Having witnessed the futility of medical knowledge against the Mania disaster, she once questioned the meaning of medicine itself. During her travels, she claimed to save lives merely to *earn good karma for her own profit*, yet in reality she consistently provided medical assistance at minimal cost, subconsciously still searching for her true purpose as a healer.",
    "Performance 1": "During her missions, she frequently encounters random accidents such as extreme weather changes and electrical leakage of devices, etc. These incidents take various forms with highly unpredictable triggering conditions. Staff have also reported that since the subject was detained, the occurrences of such bad luck-driven events within the Bureau have far exceeded all previous totals combined.",
    "Performance 2": "The subject has a passion for cultivating medicinal herbs. To determine the medicinal value of plants unique to DisCity, she has conducted numerous experiments in the greenhouse and tirelessly uses herself as a test subject. Despite multiple attempts to dissuade her from this practice, such efforts have only seen very limited effect.",
    "Performance 3": "Out of her healer instinct, the subject shows great concern for others' physical conditions, frequently offering pulse-reading diagnoses within the Bureau. The exotic Eastian medical practice once became a fad among Sinners. However, due to her mystical and pessimistic diagnostic style, many remain skeptical of her conclusions despite the ultimately positive treatment outcomes.",
    "Performance 4": "To help strengthen Chief's health, she's developed a complex daily regimen combining the foundation of Eastian medical arts with the essence of DisCity medicine. After one month of compulsory implementation, Chief's finally managed, through persistent negotiation, to reduce the dosage from three bowls of medicine daily to just one."

    "Case": "Eastside Maniac Harboring Case",
    "Criminal Record 1": "Covered up the existence of Maniacs in Eastside and provided Maniacs with help, leading to considerable contamination risk to Eastside. After such crimes were exposed, the subject intentionally obstructed the FAC's law enforcement and even assaulted FAC officials with special power. Although no casualties resulted, the subject's refusal to comply with an identity check suggests other intentions for the cover-up of Maniacs, and stricter interrogations are thus required.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "The subject has been identified as the daughter of the Spencer family after her arrest. Interrogation reveals that the subject harbored Mania patients entirely out of sympathy and *excessive charity*.\nDue to her special identity, the Bureau has attempted a negotiation with the Spencers.

    "Arrest Records 3": "The youngest daughter of the prestigious Spencer family, the subject has many elder siblings. She has received aristocratic private education since childhood and has dipped into the piano, dance, and painting, yet is versed in none. The subject therefore had a low status in the family and was often neglected.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject doesn't wish to affect the family with her Sinner identity and has forsaken the family name, merely joining the MBCC as Chief's assistant. Kept in the dark, the Spencer family mistook that the subject had died and held a grand funeral, which many of the Eastside's rich and powerful attended to mourn her passing.",
    "Performance 1": "The subject has lost her way multiple times in the Bureau. Once, the subject intruded into Chief's private space accidentally and was so mortified by it that she requested punishment. After the staff customized a map for the subject, she seems to get lost less often now.",
    "Performance 2": "Has no concept of money and once spent close to ten thousand DisCoins on bird food to save frail birds. Feeling deeply guilty after knowing about the difficulties it brought to the Supply Office, the subject voluntarily took up first-aid duties and promised to overachieve to compensate for it.",
    "Performance 3": "Thoughts on the subject are polarized among the Sinners. Most people appreciate her kind and easygoing nature, but a small number of Sinners are annoyed by her excessive sympathy and feel humiliated by it.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject's father has had multiple negotiations with the MBCC to regain his daughter's custody, but the subject has rejected the requests personally. According to some staff, Ariel turned down her father's requests because she'd rather stay beside Chief than become a tool for political marriage."

    "Criminal Record 1": "Carried out medical activities in a controversial organization \"SALVA\" and hid the Sinner's identity for a long time. In the name of the clinic's head nurse, the subject collected and froze the remains of Mania patients without the patients' permission. Associated with the incident the subject was involved in years ago—the alleged loss of a high-risk contaminant source at the Eastside-Syndicate isolation site—the subject was judged to have a high Mania transmission risk and needed to be in targeted control.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "While she worked at the *SALVA Hospital*, the subject mainly provided auxiliary medical care. She preserved the Mania patients' bodies in the hope of searching for a cure and she never took part in any illegal activity.\nOther allegations against the subject have been proven untrue. During the Syndican quarantine point incident, the subject's power awakened when she was treating a patient. She was hence not infected and her special power doesn't come with a risk of infection.",
    "Ability Summary": "Able to change fluid's chemical properties and gives drugs in syringes better healing effect according to the patient's needs.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Recently awakened. The subject claimed to have been in a confined room with several infected patients for an extended period of time. Mutation was presumed to occur due to the overwhelming stress. Detailed background is to be investigated.",
    "Corruption State": "No visual mutation was found. The mental state was normal, but with severe nightmares and failed psychological tests. The mental erosion symptoms may be suppressed through subjective strong mental power.",
    "Arrest Records 1": "Due to the SALVA Hospital force, Eastside failed to arrest the subject and handed the subject over to the MBCC for enforcement. The subject still defended SALVA Hospital and showed no resistance during the arrest.",

    "Arrest Records 3": "Entered Banyan Medical College to study a nursing degree in Eastside through self-study, and later worked at a first-line Eastside public hospital. The subject's qualification was revoked after the isolation site incident, then the subject was hired by the SALVA Hospital as a head nurse.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "After the outbreak of contamination at the isolation site, the FAC immediately blocked the news and reached an agreement with the subject to execute all infected patients within a time limit. The subject violated the agreement and escaped with the patient, \"Paige.\" The FAC masked this infection was as a viral epidemic.",
    "Performance 1": "Took up the responsibility for medical treatment and relieved the burden on the MBCC's medical department. No one has ever seen the subject without a uniform. The question of \"when does Anne get off work\" has become a popular topic among Sinners.",

It is reported that the banners and bouquets the subject received from recovered patients have flooded the SALVA Hospital and will be transferred to be stored at the MBCC temporarily.",
    "Performance 3": "Feared by some Sinners due to the subject's crime of freezing the infected. After knowing that the subject had no interest in studying Sinners, the tension has eased.

If Chief is found to be using electronic devices in a dark environment, the devices will be confiscated immediately.

    "Criminal Record 1": "Dudu is an unregistered Outlander who entered Syndicate illegally from a satellite city five years ago. In these five years, she has committed many crimes in DisCity, like business fraud and conducting business without a license. She is the bane of the lives of the Syndican citizens.\nDudu helped Oak Casket traffic in contraband, and then helped cover up Oak Casket's criminal activities. This is a serious crime; she must be detained immediately.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "As an Outlander, the subject was a nomad prior to detention and had a rough lifestyle. In the highly unstable environment in Syndicate, she already chose the least harmful way to make a living.\nAfter being detained by the MBCC, her life has greatly improved. She also uses her power to aid Sinner missions. The subject's power provides effective assistance and she has played a key role in several missions.",
    "Ability Summary": "Dudu uses sound waves to stimulate the secretion of adrenalin, a substance that enhances one's self-healing ability and physical strength. By concentrating her mind, she can direct her power at a specific person.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Dudu got caught in a gang war when she was a teenager, and was infected with Mania after being exposed to the Mania weapons used in the war. The infection was worsened by her prolonged exposure to the corpses of Corruptors, and she eventually awakened her power.",
    "Corruption State": "The physical examination conducted by the MBCC on Dudu shows that the results for every item except *severity of infection* are within the normal range; Dudu suffers from a low level of Maniac corruption, but no abnormalities have been found on her body, and her mental status is relatively stable.",

    "Arrest Records 2": "Dudu once joined a ceremonial band that worked for a gang, but the band broke up after the gang was wiped out. Dudu, now without a stable job, drifts around in Syndicate and, thanks to Oak Casket, plays at funerals and in banquets here and there.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "Dudu's power is highly stimulating to life beings. Since she awakened her power, Dudu has been based in Syndicate, where she has stirred up many gang wars and civil unrest. Most often than not, Dudu creates confusion as a distraction from her smuggling activities.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Dudu is an unregistered Outlander who came to Syndicate from a satellite city located far away.

Later on, the troupe was annihilated in a large gang war where Mania weapons were used, with Dudu being the only survivor.",
    "Performance 1": "The MBCC didn't confiscate Dudu's Suona when she was detained. And now she plays it on and off the clock, whenever it pleases her. Once, the MBCC received 118 complaints about Dudu's Suona playing in one day, both from the other Sinners and MBCC staffers.",
    "Performance 2": "Dudu has a strong opinion about the food in the MBCC cafeteria. She once mounted a protest by eating nothing but steamed rice mixed with soy sauce and chili paste for a whole month, but called it quit when nothing came of it. At the moment, she is cultivating good relations with the cafeteria staffers, trying to earn herself a chance to cook.",
    "Performance 3": "No one wants to live next to Dudu's room, except for Oak Casket. Other than that, Dudu gets along well enough with the other Sinners. She once went stargazing with Stargazer, and they read each other's palms.",
    "Performance 4": "When Chief successfully lessens Oak Casket's Maniac symptoms, Dudu becomes more trusting of Chief, and starts to rein in her unruliness and becomes nicer to Chief. \"The food in your cafeteria is atrocious. You hungry? Would you like me to make a bowl of noodles for you?\" she once said to Chief."

    "Criminal Record 2": "Growing up in a repressive environment, the subject abused her power after her awakening and frequently loitered at night. Though she enjoyed pranking pedestrians, she meant only to give them directions and no harm. With Chief's counseling, her stress has been relieved and her natural character unleashed. She's gradually redirecting her energy to normal social activities and hobbies and no longer poses a threat of stirring up public panic.",

    "Arrest Records 4": "The subject owns a self-edited *DisCity Adventure Journal* that records various strange attractions in DisCity gathered from the internet, magazines, and urban legends, accompanied by detailed guides. Field visits have later proven most descriptions to be inaccurate, but she doesn't seem to regret her selection of locations.",
    "Performance 1": "Ever since her detention, *paranormal activities* have begun to be observed in the Bureau. Witnesses claim to be constantly followed by an unidentified bright light during night patrols.

    "Performance 2": "The subject often interviews other Sinners on their experiences and strange stories outside the Bureau and notes down the details. She claims she's doing this to enrich her Adventure Journal, and that its content will be expanded to include not only DisCity but Outlands as well.",
    "Performance 3": "Obsessed with rare and cute dolls and decorations, the subject shares a common topic with Sinners with similar interests around her age. However, due to differences in their backgrounds, she sometimes faces challenges when communicating with Syndican Sinners, but they try their best to understand each other.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject often barges into Chief's bedroom while ”sleepwalking“ at night and proceeds to rest there. Once awake, she explains that she approaches Chief unconsciously because she feels reassured around Chief and that she's not doing it on purpose."

    "Arrest Records 4": "After witnessing her foster father's atrocities, the subject awakened her special power in extreme horror, which traumatized her sense of smell: she now constantly smells an unbearable stench.

However, her perfumes' scent never lasts long enough, so she has always longed to create an \"Immortal Fragrance\" that will never fade.",

However, she showed an extraordinary interest in specific people, expressing her admiration and approval by imagining and describing their scents. Without exception, all of these people have beautiful appearances.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject regularly receives psychological counseling and rehabilitation from the Chief. During these sessions, she has repeatedly expressed her wish to make perfume inspired by the Chief, but has not been granted permission."

Given the dangerous nature of her past actions, immediate detention is recommended.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Interrogation confirms the flight radio interference incident was the result of a Mania-induced outburst of her special power rather than an intentional act. Aviation means a lot to her, and even during her time in the MBCC, she continued seeking opportunities to pilot an aircraft again. Following an attempted aerial escape, she reached an agreement with Chief to comply with the Bureau's bail conditions in exchange for restricted freedom.",
    "Ability Summary": "The subject can interfere with signal transmission using a wireless pager as a medium. In combat situations, she can manipulate intercepted signals to influence physical targets and neural pathways, suppressing pain and distracting enemies.",

    "Arrest Records 1": "Initial contact between the subject and Chief occurred by chance at an Eastside bar.

She was then transferred to the MBCC for detention.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject completed her formal aviation training and obtained the official pilot certification in Eastside.

Despite not being qualified to pilot an aircraft at the moment, she remains obsessed with flying.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The subject's parents have divorced and since established new families.

Since then, she has continuously sought ways to heal her old injuries and another chance to fly a plane.",
    "Performance 1": "At the start of her detention, the subject was set on challenging and violating the Bureau's rules.

Although she usually displays a relatively cooperative attitude when she receives her punishment, her behavior has not improved.",
    "Performance 2": "Folding paper planes is the subject's primary means of communication and entertainment, and she has organized a series of paper plane contests in the Outdoor Activity Area, which briefly became a trend within the Bureau.

    "Performance 3": "The subject is outgoing and well-regarded within the Bureau. But while she's respectful toward conservative-minded Sinners, she doesn't seem to know how to get along with them. When subjected to their lectures, she usually just covers her ears and slips away.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject once got drunk and barged into the office, forcing Chief to listen to the one hundred things they'd do together after their elopement. When questioned the next day, the now-sober subject openly admitted to her plans, stating they were all serious ideas that could be executed immediately upon Chief's agreement."

    "Criminal Record 1": "Disregards the DisCity regulations and used her powers to break into high-end residential areas without a permit, causing disorder, unrest and property damage.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "After her arrest, the subject claimed that she trespassed on the residential area because she heard a rumor that there was cultivable land there.\nSince the subject obviously lacks basic legal concept and common sense, the Bureau has enrolled her in certain hours of civic education lessons. She's completed the course now. Though its actual effectiveness is hard to assess, at least such absurd events are unlikely to reoccur.",

    "Corruption State": "The subject considered the purple spots on the hands as an external sign of erosion by corruption. The purple spots were later diagnosed to be ordinary bruises. The mutation has very limited effects on the subject, and all her indexes are normal with minimal erosion.",

    "Criminal Record 2": "The interviews with several witnesses reveal that the subject's actions during the family restaurant incident were an act of self-defense after her and her family's lives were threatened. Her merciless way could be attributed to the nature of her prosthesis.\nIn the inspection following her detention, it's been found that her special power has granted her full compatibility with her prosthesis. With enough education, all violent behaviors in her can be effectively prevented.",
    "Ability Summary": "The power is not aggressive but is merely a perfect fit for artificial implants, which also allows the subject to perfectly manipulate the prosthesis and cold weapon armament.",
    "Awakening Signs": "Experienced a direct Black Ring mutation and suffered a severe infection. The subject's power is suspected to be awakened when striving to survive the pollution. A rare Black Ring's survivor deserves further observation.",
    "Corruption State": "The original body was almost completely eroded, except for the brain, which was replaced by a robot. The state of physical mutation is unknown. The infection of the brain resulted in amnesia, but the current situation is stable. No recurrence or deterioration of amnesia has been detected.",

The subject's emotion fits perfectly with the mechanical nerves. The subject got along well with people in the restaurant.",

    "Performance 1": "Compared to fighting, the subject seems more interested in cleaning and tidying up. The prosthesis allows extremely high efficiency, which made the cleaners become idle and get rebuked.",
    "Performance 2": "The maintenance workers noticed that the subject was unusually talkative when carrying out household chores. The language module was overloaded. Another file named \"Anti-amnesia diary\" over-occupied the system. Useless information of the subject's conversation with herself accounted for more than 80%. The subject is speculated to have an outgoing personality before pre-modification.",
    "Performance 3": "Temporarily loses the ability to carry out household chores and rational judgment in front of the researchers. Quickly switched to combat mode to protect herself from being dismantled and studied. Behaves normally otherwise. No complaints have been received from other Sinners against her, except for being too chatty.",
    "Performance 4": "Made multiple attempts to open the head prosthesis and invite Chief to admire the last part of its original biological tissue—the brain, which continued despite repeated rejections. \"I want to show Chief the human part of me to thank you for treating me as a human being.\""

    "Criminal Record 2": "The background check reveals that the subject has a plain personal history with no parts worth highlighting. Despite that, she's managed to survive the chaotic Syndicate with her eloquence and bluffing skills. The subject once admitted that she felt reassured now that she was in MBCC and no longer had to spend every day in fear and worry. Awakened during an emergency, her ability has versatile uses and is handy on various missions.",

    "Criminal Record 1": "Abused special power when putting out a fire. The high-pressure water flow affected the civilian vehicles and fire trucks parked nearby, resulting in a certain amount of property damage. Though no casualties resulted, the subject's Sinner identity negatively impacted the public image of the fire department and thus the subject needs to be immediately suspended from work and detained.",
    "Criminal Record 2": "Her profile shows that she had maintained good attendance at work and showed no abnormal signs up until the great fire of Eastside. It's therefore believed that the fire awakened her special power. Since her detention, it's been found that the subject has poor control over her power and she wishes to improve. The Bureau has thus built a special facility for her to store equipment and practice controlling her power. The subject's presence has eliminated the fire prevention pitfalls within the Bureau and has been beneficial to all other Sinners' safety.",
    "Ability Summary": "Able to produce high-pressure water flow out of thin air which has an ultra-long-range linear course, only the release must rely on a medium. The subject is permitted to keep the reinforced fire hose supplied by the fire department to aid in battles.",
    "Awakening Signs": "The subject's ability awakened amid a severe fire in Eastside due to the subject's strong will to save the victims. The first release of their power was too demanding that the subject was unable to cease it in time after the fire was put out, resulting in damage.",
    "Corruption State": "Shows a fairly low degree of mutation and infection. Having had professional firefighter training, the subject's physical ability is far higher than that of the average woman of the same age. No corruption symptoms have been detected.",

Still comprehending the situation during the arrest, the subject appeared dazed and did not resist.",
    "Arrest Records 2": "The subject's father was a firefighter of the Eastside Fire Department who has saved countless lives and was generally revered within the field. He retired after suffering severe injuries during an assignment and now runs a grocery store with his wife. He often recounts his heroic stories to his daughter and had a deep influence on Flora in her childhood.",
    "Arrest Records 3": "The only female firefighter in Eastside who joined the Eastside Fire Department with her father's recommendation and despite her mother's objection. However, the subject was never able to operate firefighting tools smoothly. Dismissed for being a woman and for being recommended by her own father, she never got to serve on the front line and was put to handle fire safety promotion work.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "When the fire broke out in Eastside, all the firefighters in the city were summoned except for Flora. She was even made to leave, being told that she would hinder the firefighting process as a mere promotion officer. But the fire brigade was unable to put out the fire effectively, and the fire would have gone totally out of control if it hadn't been for the subject's awakening.",
    "Performance 1": "Still keeping the old habit from the fire department, the subject's detention room is simply decorated. Besides essential everyday products, the subject only keeps a childhood photo with her father and the user manuals of every machine in the Bureau. Despite that, the subject still tends to break machines due to improper operation.",
    "Performance 2": "Insisted on reading aloud the 100 fire safety tips every morning through the Bureau's PA system for a while. After the staff installed a fingerprint lock for the PA room, the unique morning alarm finally ceased. But everyone has already been brainwashed by the subject's announcement, and it actually has served the purpose of hazard prevention during a few critical moments.",
    "Performance 3": "Demonstrates normal social behavior and gets along well with Sinners and staff. But when faced with Sinners with fire abilities, the subject will suddenly become extra paranoid and may even do absurd things such as stalking those Sinners. The subject has received several warnings due to such suspicious behaviors.",
    "Performance 4": "Based on the layout of Chief's office, the subject has redesigned the fire escape route and listed out all the safe spots in the office that can provide cover. Chief's Fire Safety Manual contains 99 pages in which all the text and illustrations were written and drawn by hand by Flora."

Since her detention, the Bureau's unique environment has made socializing less difficult for her. The specially fortified kitchen also allows her to experiment with her power.\nMost of her problems have been resolved now. She can also control her power and apply it in different areas.",

    "Arrest Records 3": "During the subject's studies at Blue Ribbon Culinary School, the subject failed all subjects apart from iced desserts due to the subject's loss of sense of taste, and had to repeat for three consecutive years. The fourth final exams were only passed with the school's permission, but the subject eventually was expelled from school due to the identity of a Sinner.",
    "Arrest Records 4": "Born with a lack of taste and can only taste dishes at extremely low temperatures, which is a tremendous hindrance in culinary studies. However, the exam stress had led to a complete loss of taste. Now, the subject can only taste food that has a temperature close to liquid nitrogen.",
    "Performance 1": "Due to the subject's special diet, the MBCC logistics department prepared special low temperature recipes for her, which still failed to meet her needs. Due to personality flaws, the subject dares not to voice her opinion but only sneak into the kitchen late at night to get extra meals.",
    "Performance 2": "Extremely cooperative with missions but rarely able to complete them. Often starts to carry out missions without fully understanding the mission. Due to the repeated mistakes and panic, Sinners with fire abilities were arranged to deal with the ice accident.",
    "Performance 3": "Extremely passionate about making ice cream and has received a lot of praise from Sinners who have a sweet tooth. The subject's loner personality was improved through ice cream.",
    "Performance 4": "New ice cream was created, and a chair was added to the kitchen, which was said to be Chief's reserved tasting seat. But because the subject \"hesitated whether to invite Chief\" for too long, when Chief tried the ice cream, it had already melted into a milkshake."

Essentially treating the canteen as a bar, the subject needs only to order a cosmopolitan with lime on the rocks and can then chat away the whole day with other Sinners.",
    "Performance 4": "The subject has a pretty solid fan base within the MBCC and the fans have even started a fan club. By the subject's request, the *fan number 00001* title has been reserved for Chief, which comes with the privilege to give song requests for a live guitar solo performance."
